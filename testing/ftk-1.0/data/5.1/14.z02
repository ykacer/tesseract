A winter hayride
is all work for
ranch hands David
Flournoy and Rick
Littler, packing feed
in Modoc County.
Down in Red Bluff,
heart of the state's
cattle country, the
Bull and Gelding
Sale attracts cow-
pokes (below) from
across the West. The
Stetsons may not
have changed in the
show's 52 years, but
other things have.
Says manager Tyler
Martinez, "This year
one auction bidder
was getting instruc-
tions from his boss
on a cellular phone.
That's the first time
I've seen that."
