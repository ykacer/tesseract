Israeli, PLO talks cover everything from stamps




  CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -~ On one side of
the table sits Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, born
in Tel Aviv four years before Israel was
founded in 1948.
  On the other is Nabil Shaath, a Palestin-
ian businessman who was 8 when his family
was exiled that year from Jaffa, then an Arab
town, now a Tel Aviv suburb.
  They lead the Israeli and PLO teams
that have negotiated for six months on how
to implement the Israeli-PLO peace accord
signed Sept. 13 at the White House.
  In talks that resume today, they hope to
work out the final details of Israel's
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank town of Jericho, so Palestinian
self-rule can begin.




  So far, the debate has been difficult -~
harsh at times -~ to the point that the
negotiators missed the Dec. 13 target for
Israel to start the withdrawal and a second
deadline, last Wednesday, for completing it.
  Shahak says strains between the two
sides run deep.
  In an interview with the Israeli newspa-
per Yedioth Ahronoth, he decried the Pales-
tinian team's anger when Israel recessed the
talks to mark Holocaust Day in memory of
six million Jews killed by the Nazis.
  "Nabil is perhaps one of the few on the
other side who knows something about the
Holocaust," Shahak said. "It could be that we
have the same problems in understanding
their sensitivities."




  The Palestinians want not only the cor-
ner of Palestine offered for autonomy, but
anything that can be construed as a symbol
of the future state they seek.
  One argument has been over whether
they would have their own postage stamps.
Shaath, 54, is a stamp collector.
  The Israelis have sought to focus the
negotiations on security, for Jewish settlers
in the occupied territories and for Israel
itself.
  That is Shahak's area. A career military
man, he commanded a paratroop unit in the
1967 Middle East war, when Israel captured
Gaza and the West Bank. He also served in
intelligence and is now the army's deputy
chief of staff.
