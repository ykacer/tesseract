Oven-fried Potato Salad
1~~~ pounds small (about 1~~~-in.-
       diameter) red thin-skinned
       potatoes
     About 2 tablespoons olive oil or
       salad oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
~~~ cup thinly sliced green onion
3 tablespoons minced parsley
~~~ teaspoon pepper
    Salt

Scrub potatoes and cut into ~~~-inch-thick
slices (to brown evenly, slices must be
uniformly thick); discard the ends of the
potatoes.
Brush 2 baking pans, each 10 by 15 inch-
es, with oil. Arrange slices in a single
layer; lightly brush tops of potatoes with
more oil. Bake in a 450~ oven until both
sides are deep, golden brown, about 25
minutes. Check frequently after 10 min-
utes for even browning; turn over slices
that are not cooking evenly, or move to a
cooler or hotter area of pan, as needed.
As slices are browned, transfer with a
wide spatula to a serving bowl. (If made
ahead, let stand, uncovered, up to 3
hours.) To potatoes, add vinegar, onion,
parsley, and pepper; mix gently. Add salt
to taste. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
