After being injured in a car crash, a 46-year-old Massachusetts man
began speaking with a French accent-~a victim of a rare neurological
disorder, Foreign Accent Syndrome. The syndrome, usually a result
of stroke or head trauma, results from damage to an area of the brain
involved in controlling the vocal chords, reports neurologist Majaz
Moonis of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worces-
ter. Still, much remains mysterious: Why, for example, a French ac-
cent? The patient had no French ancestry and the farthest he'd ever
ventured from his hometown of Worcester was a trip to New Jersey.
