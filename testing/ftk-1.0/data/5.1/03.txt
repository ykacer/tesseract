perature survey of a desert vegetation mosaic. Ecology 44:821-824.

From March 4 to May 9, 1960 soil temperature and moisture mea-
surements were made in 7 plant habitats on the Nevada Test Site,
Nye County, Nevada. Soil moisture was determined by gravimetric
sampling, and temperatures were measured using the sucrose inver-
sion technique. Cooler soil temperatures were not always associ-
ated with an increase in elevation. In some cases topographic
positions and soil properties influenced soil temperatures and
available soil moisture more strongly than did elevational changes.

plant recolonization of a nuclear target area. Radiation Botany 3:
41-44.

Vegetational analyses were conducted three years post-detonation
in a nuclear target area in a Grayia spinosa-Lycium andersonii
community in Yucca Flat, Nevada. Annual plants dominated the
early stage of recolonization and were quantitatively more abun-
dant in the disturbed areas than in an adjacent undisturbed shrub
community. Mentzelia albicaulis and Chaenactis stevioides
occurred in both disturbed and undisturbed areas; however, Mentzelia
was more abundant in disturbed areas while Chaenactis was more
abundant in the undisturbed community. Salsola kali was confined
to disturbed areas while Phacelia vallismortae was more often en-
countered in the undisturbed community. The plant recolonization
of a mechanically disturbed area was quantitatively and qualitative-
ly more like that of the interior zone of the nuclear target area
than less disturbed habitats. These data support a conclusion
that soil displacement presents a more rigorous habitat for plant
recolonization than disturbances created by the wider ranging de-
structive components of a nuclear detonation. (Auth)

The potential benefits to be derived for mankind from continued
development of peaceful applications for plutonium cannot be
denied. The technology of plutonium production and processing
is already established, but the realization of its peaceful appli-
cations depends largely upon the development of methods for pre-
venting its distribution in the environment. Because of safe-
guards and effective control measures, no accidental plutonium con-
tamination of the public domain has imposed serious risks to a
population group. Trace amounts of plutonium from above-ground
