Accidental accent ... Men's rights ... Playing it safe ... The bores of summer




     Wee Ur Nut Makeen Zees Oop

After being injured in a car crash, a 46-year-old Massachusetts man
began speaking with a French accent-~a victim of a rare neurological
disorder, Foreign Accent Syndrome. The syndrome, usually a result
of stroke or head trauma, results from damage to an area of the brain
involved in controlling the vocal chords, reports neurologist Majaz
Moonis of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worces-
ter. Still, much remains mysterious: Why, for example, a French ac-
cent? The patient had no French ancestry and the farthest he'd ever
ventured from his hometown of Worcester was a trip to New Jersey.




A Tough Habit to Kick "We have 434,000 deaths
each year related to cigarette smoking. It costs us an
average of $69 billion in increased health care costs
and time lost from work, and yet our government
continues to subsidize the cigarette industry. We
have to stop this." -~Dr. M. Joycelyn Elders, Surgeon
General Designate




Playground Prophylaxis

   Monkey bars, seesaws, swings
   and slides are among the joys
of summer. But each year about a
quarter of a million children end
up in emergency rooms with
injuries involving playground
equipment, according to a pam-
phlet published by the American
Academy of Orthopaedic Sur-
geons. ("Children," the pamphlet
notes in clinical deadpan, "are mar-
velously inventive, and use play-
ground equipment in many differ-
ent ways not intended by the




manufacturer.") "Play It Safe, a
Guide to Playground Safety," of-
fers suggestions for the design, use
and maintenance of equipment.

Handy Men Although
breast tumors are equally
likely to occur on either side
of the body, left-breast tumors
are detected earlier, accord-
ing to Minneapolis surgeon
Leonard Schultz. That's be-
cause the tumors are picked
up by the women's husbands,
Dr. Schultz told Physician's
Weekly, "and most men are
right-handed."




Bored to Tears




Every year for the past
eight years something




called the Boring Institute
in Maplewood, N.J., has de-
clared July "National Anti-
Boredom Month." This
July the institute highlights
the role of boredom in a
variety of serious health




problems, from eating disorders, alcohol and drug
abuse to suicide. And what's one of the institute's
main recommendations? Turn off the TV! Maybe
this whole Boring Institute idea was a cute gimmick
for a year or two-~three, tops-~but by now it's be-
ginning to seem a little...well... .
