  So far, the debate has been difficult -~
harsh at times -~ to the point that the
negotiators missed the Dec. 13 target for
Israel to start the withdrawal and a second
deadline, last Wednesday, for completing it.
  Shahak says strains between the two
sides run deep.
  In an interview with the Israeli newspa-
per Yedioth Ahronoth, he decried the Pales-
tinian team's anger when Israel recessed the
talks to mark Holocaust Day in memory of
six million Jews killed by the Nazis.
  "Nabil is perhaps one of the few on the
other side who knows something about the
Holocaust," Shahak said. "It could be that we
have the same problems in understanding
their sensitivities."
