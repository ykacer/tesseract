  The Palestinians want not only the cor-
ner of Palestine offered for autonomy, but
anything that can be construed as a symbol
of the future state they seek.
  One argument has been over whether
they would have their own postage stamps.
Shaath, 54, is a stamp collector.
  The Israelis have sought to focus the
negotiations on security, for Jewish settlers
in the occupied territories and for Israel
itself.
  That is Shahak's area. A career military
man, he commanded a paratroop unit in the
1967 Middle East war, when Israel captured
Gaza and the West Bank. He also served in
intelligence and is now the army's deputy
chief of staff.
