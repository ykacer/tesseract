slopes is evident. Furthermore, the range of Mojave prickleleaf
(Hecastocleis shockleyi Gray) was apparently attenuated on north-
ern slopes during the full glacial, while Forsellesia pungens Heller
occurred on both mesic and xeric exposures.
  Similar phenomena have been documented in the Grand Canyon
(Cole, 1981) as well as in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.
Plants presently restricted to washes in the low deserts, such as
catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii Gray), occurred on rocky slopes dur-
ing the Wisconsin (Van Devender, 1973; Van Devender and
Spaulding, 1979). Van Devender and Riskind (1979) have recorded
the presence of woodland on limestone during the late glacial in the
Hueco Mountains of western Texas. These mesophytic plants persist
in the area to this day but are restricted to outcrops of syenite. The
