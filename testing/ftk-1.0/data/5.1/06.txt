  LOS ANGELES -~ Prosecutors are con-
sidering filing charges against a man whose
10-year-old son committed suicide in front
of an elementary school with his father's
gun, police said.
  Adults can face three years in prison and
a $10,000 fine for keeping a loaded weapon
accessible to a minor. Police said the boy
found the .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol
under a mattress and loaded it with ammu-
nition he found in a bedroom dresser.
  "The District Attorney's Office is taking
a look at that .~.~. to see if there is enough
there to press charges," Detective John
Garcia said Friday. "They won't have an
answer until sometime next week."
  Jorge Licea was sobbing when he put the
gun to his temple and pulled the trigger just
before 7:30 a.m. Wednesday on a sidewalk
in front of the 49th Street Elementary
School in the South-Central area. Classes
were about to begin.
  The fifth-grader was removed from life
support Thursday and declared dead.
  Police, school officials and Jorge's par-
ents struggled to understand the tragedy.
  School officials said Jorge was suspended
Tuesday for using profane language in the
classroom. Principal Lemuel Chavis said
the boy was given a note asking his parents
to come into the school Wednesday.

  "Why do I think he did it?" Garcia asked.
"I've spoken to the teacher briefly, and I
think the boy was upset about being
suspended."
  Jorge's father, Jorge Ramiro Licea Agui-
lar, said his son was affected by frequent
discipline at school, especially when he was
forced to apologize in front of his class.
  "Jorge was very sensitive. It was really
hard on him. But we had no idea how hard,"
he said. "My son swallowed his problems.
This is so hard. As close as we were, he
didn't tell me."
  But Chavis said that wasn't enough of a
reason in itself.
  "It's difficult for me to fathom that a note
