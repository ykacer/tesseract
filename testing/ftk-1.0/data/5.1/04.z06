		LATITUDINAL SHIFTS

On desert mountain ranges, the elevation of lower woodland boun-
daries declines with decreasing latitude from the Great Basin Desert
though the Mojave Desert to the Sonoran Desert (Martin, 1963b;
Wells, 1979). For example, at about 1430 m elevation, creosote
bush/white bursage occurs in the northwestern Mojave Desert (at
about latitude 37~N), and oak woodland occurs at similar altitudes
above the northeastern Sonoran Desert (at about latitude 32~N)
(Figure 14-9). An increasing proportion and amount of summer
precipitation to the south and east (Bryson and Lowry, 1955; Hales,
