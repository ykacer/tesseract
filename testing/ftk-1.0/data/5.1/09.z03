The second salad is a colorful mix of two
tender squash: green zucchini and yellow
crookneck. You cook them whole to get a
pleasantly firm texture, scoop out the
seedy centers, and slice to create decora-
tive half-moon shapes.
Serve the salads together, perhaps with
cheese and bread for a simple meal; or
offer them separately, when your menu
calls for potatoes or squash. Both salads
use an unusually small amount of oil.
