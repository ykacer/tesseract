A Tough Habit to Kick "We have 434,000 deaths
each year related to cigarette smoking. It costs us an
average of $69 billion in increased health care costs
and time lost from work, and yet our government
continues to subsidize the cigarette industry. We
have to stop this." -~Dr. M. Joycelyn Elders, Surgeon
General Designate
