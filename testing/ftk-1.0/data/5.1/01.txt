Somatic Effects: Cancer				353




malignant lymphoma has been identified in the followup of infants given
radiation therapy for thymic enlargement.9 Two new cases were observed
in the treated infants in the fourth survey (bringing the total to eight, com-
pared with 3.97 expected). The highest dose group contained two cases,
with 0.49 expected. No increase was observed in the sibling control
groups. Thus, from all the evidence reviewed, it seems highly probable
that malignant lymphoma is increased in children after high levels of
radiation exposure. The appearance of increased risk comes later than for
leukemia and may last longer.

Multiple Myeloma  Since the 1973 study,32 a more extensive study of
multiple myeloma12 has identified 22 confirmed cases among survivors in
the LSS sample: 14 in Hiroshima and eight in Nagasaki. With the data of
the two cities pooled for analysis, those exposed to 100+ rads kerma have
a significantly increased risk relative to that of those exposed to less than 1
rad (relative risk, 4-7). Excess mortality was estimated at 0.45 death per
million persons per rad of marrow dose for the mixed neutron and gamma
radiation.12

Summary

Extensive information has been accumulated on hematologic malignan-
cies (especially leukemia) after whole-body radiation exposure. Because of
the low natural occurrence of leukemia, the high radiosensitivity of stem
cells, and the short minimal latent period (2-3 yr), leukemia was recog-
nized early as a potential consequence of high-level radiation exposure in
man.31 To understand the pathophysiology of these diseases and the
mechanisms by which radiation exerts its effects, many experimental
studies have been conducted in a large number of animal strains. These
have led to several important conclusions that bear on the interpretation
of dose-response curves derived from epidemiologic studies in man. Given
the body of knowledge derived from controlled animal studies and parallel
(but uncontrolled) studies in persons exposed to high doses (where
statistically valid observations can be made), we have been led to fit the
observed data to models that are consistent with animal and human data.
  Leukemia induction after low doses of low-LET radiation in experi-
mental studies in mammals is curvilinear, with decreasing effectiveness
per rad at the lowest doses. Also, a decrease in effect is seen at pro-
gressively diminished dose rates. The data indicate that small amounts of
radiation-induced damage can be repaired to a substantial extent. Similar
repair mechanisms are believed to operate in man, inasmuch as they occur
in so many different organisms.
