  CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -~ On one side of
the table sits Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, born
in Tel Aviv four years before Israel was
founded in 1948.
  On the other is Nabil Shaath, a Palestin-
ian businessman who was 8 when his family
was exiled that year from Jaffa, then an Arab
town, now a Tel Aviv suburb.
  They lead the Israeli and PLO teams
that have negotiated for six months on how
to implement the Israeli-PLO peace accord
signed Sept. 13 at the White House.
  In talks that resume today, they hope to
work out the final details of Israel's
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank town of Jericho, so Palestinian
self-rule can begin.
