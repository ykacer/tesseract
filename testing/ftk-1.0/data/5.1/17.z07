you're shopping new- or used-car lots, look for well-established
dealers with reputations to protect.
  But before you hit the streets, do some homework. Check your
local library for Consumer Reports magazine's latest April issue,
devoted completely to cars. Its "frequency of repair" data on various
makes and models can steer you clear of clunkers. To determine
the fair market value of a car, check the National Automobile Deal-
ers Association (NADA) Official Used Car Guide, also known as "the
blue book," available in the reference section of most libraries and in
some banks. Some affiliate clubs of the American Automobile Asso-
ciation will also quote members the price over the phone.
  Once you've narrowed down your options, choose a clear day and
close friend for your car hunt. You'll need both to look for nicks and
listen for knocks. Some red lights to watch for:
ELECTRICAL BREAKDOWN Test all the switches by having your friend
stand outside to confirm that signals and lights are working proper-
ly. Electrical problems can mean costly repair work.
HOLES IN THE DASHBOARD These could be a sign you're in an old cab or
police car that had equipment mounted on the dash. (Bullet holes
are another telltale sign.) A tough past may preclude a long future.
RAMPANT RUST Wheel wells, rocker panels (under doors) and door
edges are most vulnerable to damage. Look for flaking paint, often a
sign of underlying rust. A little shouldn't concern you, but if rust has
eaten through the trunk or interior floor, lethal fumes can enter the car.
BLUE SMOKE Take the car out for a test drive, get it up to highway
speed, then take your foot off the accelerator for a few seconds. If
you spot blue smoke billowing from the exhaust, the car is burning
oil. Major engine repairs ahead.
BENT BODY Drive through a puddle, then check the tire tracks left by 
the wet wheels (or ask a friend to watch from behind). The rear tires
should directly follow the tracks of the front tires. If they don't, the
body or frame has been bent. Don't buy it.
LYING MILES It's illegal to tamper with odometers. Even so, it's esti-
mated that mileage counters are rolled back on more than half of 
the used cars sold every year. There's no surefire way to spot
