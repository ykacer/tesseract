CONSULTATION DRAFT




The samples are placed in sterile bottles and immediately returned to the
laboratory for analysis. A mineral salts medium is used to culture these
microorganisms. A controlled amount of drilling fluid is added as the only
energy source for microorganism growth. Solid media are inoculated with
washings of the soil samples. After aerobic or anaerobic incubation at room
temperature, isolated bacterial colonies growing on the medium are transfer-
red to fresh media and incubated to obtain pure colonies. Colony morphology
and microscopic characteristics and viscosity can then be determined. The
growth of microorganisms indigenous to tuff from Yucca Mountain will also be
studied utilizing exploratory shaft samples.

  This study will determine the sorption ratio of radionuclides on
bacteria. A steady-state sorption ratio for the bacteria and radionuclides
will be determined. This is necessary to affix a value to bacterial sorption
of radionuclides. The cellular location (internal versus external) of
actinide sorption will be investigated to determine the stability of sorp-
tion. Furthermore, this study will determine if microorganisms preferen-
tially sorb different oxidation states of a radionuclide. Sorption testing
will be done primarily with plutonium, americium, and neptunium, on core
samples from USW G-4 (1,501 ft) using well J-13 water. Samples from the
exploratory shaft will be used when they become available.

  The previously unstudied effects of microorganisms on the movement of
actinides through fractured and unfractured tuff will be examined by deter-
mining the movement of plutonium, americium, and neptunium sorbed to bac-
teria. This work will determine if the movement is a function of the bio-
logical mobility or the colloidal dispersion of the bacteria. Furthermore,
the movement of radionuclides chelated by bacterial metabolites (i.e., sider-
ophores) through fractured and unfractured tuff will be determined.

Methods and technical procedures

  Standard microbiological laboratory equipment and supplies will be used.
Furthermore, standard microbiological laboratory procedures will be used
using methods from the following references:

  1.	Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology. American Society for
	Microbiology (Gerhardt, 1981).

  2.	Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Waste Water. American
	Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, Water
	Pollution Control Federation (APHA, AWWA, WPCF, 1985).

  3.	Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Holt (1984).

  Each of these references has been subjected to extensive peer review
before publication; therefore, they are widely accepted among microbiologists
as containing methods that will give consistent and reproducible results.
Established procedures for sorption testing should be easily adapted to
laboratory testing using microorganisms.

  Procedures to be written include:

  1.	Isolation of microorganisms.
