The applied ~Ede can be selected in the range 20 to 50 mV.
This is a higher range than that which can be reliably
employed with anodic or cathodic polarization alone. The
higher range is justified by the extended linear polarization
curves characteristic of dual electrodes.11
  The Direct method yields a mean corrosion current I~~
which is not the arithmetic mean of the corrosion currents
at the individual test electrodes (I~~ and I~~), but is given
by~~~
