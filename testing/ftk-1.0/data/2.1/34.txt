Area Teenagers Are Having Sex Earlier
And With More Partners, Specialists Say

  Six teenage friends sit in a Cen-
treville cafe, trading stories of sexu-
al liaisons in between cigarettes and
sips of jasmine tea. They talk of one-
night stands. Long-term courtships.
Brief flings carried out in the com-
fort of their middle-class homes.
  A pause, then a question:
  "Do you think," a 16-year-old girl
asks an adult visitor, "that teenagers
can really be in love?"
  Over at Kennedy High School in
Wheaton, another cluster of teen-
agers huddles around a library table,
listening to a college-bound senior
recount how he lost his virginity at a
small party, at age 12.
  Another 17-year-old Maryland
youth, Eugene, says that during
three years of sexual activity-~with
seven partners-~he has rarely used




a condom and fears he will contract
AIDS.
  These students tell the story of
adolescent sex in the 1990s. It is a
disturbing tale confirmed by coun-
selors and health professionals:
Teenagers appear to be starting
their sex lives younger, many of
them in middle school, and many are
having intercourse with multiple
partners before they finish high
school.
  This portrait emerged from re-
cent interviews with two dozen sex-
ually active teenagers from the
Washington area. Some asked not to
be named, and others asked to be
identified only by their first names.
The teenagers spanned the racial
and socioeconomic spectrum; they
included class clowns, ace students,
orchestra members and top athletes.
  In hours of interviews, the teen-
agers said they regularly have sex at
home while their parents are asleep
or away, and they frequently engage
in impromptu encounters at small
parties rife with alcohol and other
drugs. They said their sexual activi-
ty is a natural response to a sex-sat-
urated society and to crushing peer
pressure.
