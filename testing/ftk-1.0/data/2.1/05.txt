  Figure 2 depicts the characteristic curves (saturation-pressure relationships)
for the matrix (Peters et al., 1984) and the vertical fractures in the five units. As
apparent from Figure 2, the fractures in all units easily desaturate with a small
suction of -0.1 m to -1. m of pressure head. For the matrix, significant desatura-
tion occurs only when the pressure-heads are in the order of -100 m. For the
welded Tiva Canyon unit (Fig. 2a), the welded Topopah Spring unit (Fig. 2c) and
the zeolitic Calico Hills unit (Fig. 2e), significant saturations (0.3 or more) can be
maintained even with pressure heads in the -1,000 m range. For the nonwelded
Paintbrush unit (Fig. 2b) and the vitric Calico Hills unit (Fig. 2d), most of the
saturation change occurs over a relatively narrow pressure range around -100 m,
indicating a nearly uniform pore-size distribution. Some of the differences in
characteristic curves between the welded and nonwelded tuff may be related to
deposition processes whereby well-sorted ash falls form the nonwelded units and
the microscopically heterogeneous induration processes convert large ash flows
into welded tuff (Sinnock, personal communication, 1985).
