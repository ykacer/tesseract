On the sidelines

This season is another washout for
Scott Verplank, once the nation's
most promising young golfer.
Verplank underwent a second
surgery on his right elbow last No-
vember, a year after the first. As
of this spring, he still couldn't
straighten the arm.
  "My career is absolutely in
jeopardy, so I'm not going to
jeopardize it any more by trying to
come back too soon," says Ver-
plank, 28. That means, at best, he
would be ready for the Qualifying
School this winter.
  Playing hurt has been one of
Verplank's problems. He made
only one of 26 cuts in 1991 before
he knew the severity of his elbow
problem; last year, he made just
one of 13 cuts after surgery for
bone spurs, which proved to be
only a partial solution. The most
recent surgery was to increase the
blood flow to his elbow.
  "I haven't watched golf on tele-
vision," Verplank reports of his
down time. "I would rather be
doing it than watching it."
