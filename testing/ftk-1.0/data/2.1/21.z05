Jersey Jim

At the Shell Houston Open, Jim
McGovern became the first New
Jersey pro to win on the PGA
Tour since Wes Ellis in 1965.
True to his roots, the 28-year-old
McGovern has no plans to move
to a warmer climate. Even though
the temperature dips below freez-
ing as early as November,
McGovern enjoys Jersey winters.
  "I like the change of seasons,
that's probably the best thing,"
says McGovern. "My family still
lives in the area. It's home, all my
friends are there."
  You might find McGovern
playing pickup hoops or taking
cuts with the local softball team
when he's home in Oradell, the
town that also produced football
coach Bill Parcells and McGov-
ern's brother Rob, an NFL line-
backer. McGovern could have
played college football himself,
but chose golf instead. While it
was a longshot for a guy from the
Garden State to make it on the
PGA Tour, it's proven to be a
wise decision.
