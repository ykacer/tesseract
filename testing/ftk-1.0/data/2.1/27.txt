izer. And both versions ex-
change data with other ACT!
and 1stACT! databases.
  When a contact's profile
changes, simply make the
changes on-screen. If several
contacts from the same com-
pany require identical changes,
you can search for them and
make the changes across all the
records simultaneously. If you
want separate records for sev-
eral contacts that share attrib-
utes (like company and ad-
dress), you can create a new
contact form that duplicates
any field you specify and lets
you make changes.




PAST PERFECT
Contact managers should keep detailed,
accessible histories of client interaction.
ACT! handles this beautifully. Select




History from the View menu and you see
a list of entries or changes made to any
field that's been defined as a History
field, each time/date stamped.
  ACT!'s search functions are powerful
without being so complex as to require




programming.
Commonly used
searches (based on
name, state, and so
on) appear in the
Lookup menu. The
Windows version
lets you customize
this menu, offering
searches for
keywords that ap-
pear anywhere in
the database. The
DOS version
zipped through our
search routine. The
Windows version's
query engine, on




the other hand, tested considerably
slower. Both versions also perform
Boolean searches.


RECONCILED

If you've loaded your ACT! database on
a portable computer, the program's
Merge feature will transfer the data back
into your desktop, updating your home
database. Both ACT! versions also have
easy two-way links to the HP 95LX Palm-
top PC.
  ACT! simplifies the process of sched-
uling appointments, tasks to do, and
phone calls. Pull down the Schedule
menu, click on the desired type of event,
and a calendar, clock, and list of activity
types pop up. Here, you can schedule
events and tasks using only your mouse
(or you can enter them manually). All ac-
tivities are entered into the contact's rec-
ord and can be set to prompt you with



an alarm and user-
defined reminder.
  In the Windows
version, you can
prioritize tasks,
schedule recurring
events, and carry
undone tasks for-
ward.

ACT WRITE
ACT! also auto-
mates your corre-
spondence. The
Windows version
really shines here.
While it offers
DDE  (Dynamic




Data Exchange) links to Windows word
processors, its internal word processor in-
cludes features used most often in letter
writing. You can specify type sizes, lay-
outs, and type attributes; add formatting
options like headers and footers; and im-
port graphics through the Clipboard.
  If you have the correct fax hardware
(the DOS version supports Intel Corp.'s
SatisFAXtion Modem and Hayes Micro-
computer Products' JT FAX cards) and
software (ACT! for Windows has a DDE
link to Delrina Technology's WinFax
Pro), you can send the document out as
a fax. More important, you can use ACT!
as your phone book for WinFax.
  Mail-merges are simple. All you need
to do is define the group, write the letter,
and print. You can even print envelopes
and labels. ACT! for DOS comes with an
add-on program that prints in additional
formats such as Rolodex cards and Day-
Timer pages.
  Both versions offer nine predefined
reports (including Activities Completed,
Future Activities, and Status Reports)
and an unlimited number of user-defined




ACT!'s search functions
are powerful without
being so complex as to
require programming.




Scheduling activities in ACT! for Windows is simplified by pop-up
calendars and drop-down pick lists.
