about electronic gear of all kinds carried on
by passengers and used in flight.  Lap-top
computers, Nintendo Game Boys, cellular
phones, videocassette recorders-~all of
these products are coming under scrutiny.
     The threat is a double-whammy.  There
are concerns that explosive devices could 
be hidden in the circuitry of electronics
and that airport X-ray inspections are not
sophisticated enough to detect them.  A
plastic explosive tucked away inside a
portable radio destroyed Pan Am flight
103 over Scotland in 1988.
     More likely, however, is the admittedly
bizarre-sounding risk that electromag-
netic signals emitted by the devices could
interfere with the navigational gadgetry of
aircraft.  Odd as that seems, some pilots
have reported planes veering off course
and gauges going haywire, attributable,
they suspect, to passengers using elec-
tronics.  In one case, a pilot reported that
some instrumentation dials dimmed sud-
denly and the needles spun around wildly
on a flight departing Chicago.  Then the
plane began flying off course.  It turned
out a passenger in row nine was using a
lap-top computer.  After he switched it off,
the panel light brightened and the naviga-
