THE COMPLEAT TRAVELER




about electronic gear of all kinds carried on
by passengers and used in flight.  Lap-top
computers, Nintendo Game Boys, cellular
phones, videocassette recorders-~all of
these products are coming under scrutiny.
     The threat is a double-whammy.  There
are concerns that explosive devices could 
be hidden in the circuitry of electronics
and that airport X-ray inspections are not
sophisticated enough to detect them.  A
plastic explosive tucked away inside a
portable radio destroyed Pan Am flight
103 over Scotland in 1988.
     More likely, however, is the admittedly
bizarre-sounding risk that electromag-
netic signals emitted by the devices could
interfere with the navigational gadgetry of
aircraft.  Odd as that seems, some pilots
have reported planes veering off course
and gauges going haywire, attributable,
they suspect, to passengers using elec-
tronics.  In one case, a pilot reported that
some instrumentation dials dimmed sud-
denly and the needles spun around wildly
on a flight departing Chicago.  Then the
plane began flying off course.  It turned
out a passenger in row nine was using a
lap-top computer.  After he switched it off,
the panel light brightened and the naviga-




tional system returned to normal.  Earlier
this year, a plane approaching John F.
Kennedy Airport in New York narrowly




missed crashing when a first-class passen-
ger turned on a CD player.  Aside from
such anecdotal information, there is no 
conclusive evidence that the electronic




gizmos are, in fact, a risk.  No one knows
for sure that those devices are what
caused the dysfunctional mechanics.
     "There is no definitive answer yet on 
most electronic devices," says Hank Price, a
spokesperson for the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).  "With cellular 
phones, some studies show they have inter-
fered with some portions of flights, but we
are not sure how and why and where, only
that they have the potential to do so."
     The Federal Communications Com-
mission prohibits the use of cellular
phones while planes are airborne; most
airlines don't allow passengers to use
them at all, even when the planes are on
the ground.  (An aircraft's own devices,
including video screens for movies and
audio systems for earphones and tele-
phones, have been designed to conform
with the navigational system, so they do
not pose a problem.)
     The Air Transport Association (ATA),
which represents the major U.S. airlines
in Washington, requested industry-wide
standards from the FAA on other elec-
tronic devices.  The FAA, however, issued
an advisory earlier this year leaving it up
to airlines to decide.  Meanwhile, an advi-
