  Basic information of this type can help the corrosion
engineer decide whether to select anodic or cathodic
polarization for linear polarization measurements on a given
corroding metal. That is not the only choice open, however.
There is a third technique, namely the dual electrode
technique-~an important variation of the small potential
approximation. It combines both anodic and cathodic
polarization in a single measurement. A two-electrode cell is
used, in which the electrodes are duplicate specimens of the
test metal. When a potential difference ~E is applied across
the two electrodes, each experiences a potential change of
0.5 ~E if the two are identical and ~E is small. Therefore,
