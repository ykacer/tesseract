to calculate corrosion current from dual-electrode measure-
ments.
  The dual electrode technique was first developed in
1963 by Marsh,10 who utilized polarity reversal of the
applied potential so that both a forward current If and a
reverse polarity current Ir were measured. The average of
these meter readings is inserted into Equation (15B) to
calculate I*. In application of this method to real corroding
metals, allowance must be made for the fact that duplicate
test electrodes seldom yield identical corrosion potentials
or corrosion currents. As Marsh showed,10 it is necessary to
determine the starting potential difference between the two
test electrodes 1 and 2, (E~~ - E~~), and to calculate the mean
current as I = 1/2 (If + Ir) when |E~~ - E~~| < |~E| and as I =
1/2 |Ir - If| when |E~~ - E~~| > |~E|.
  Marsh's reversal method has been widely applied in
engineering studies of corrosion resistant metals. In fact, in
the past decade, much more electrochemical corrosion rate
data have been generated by dual-electrode polarization
than by anodic or cathodic polarization singly.
  A simpler dual-electrode procedure, which eliminates
the polarity reversal feature of Marsh's method, was
recently reported.11 It is termed "Direct" method because
I* is calculated directly from a single current I, measured
after increasing the starting potential difference (E~~ - E~~)
by an amount ~Ede. The corrosion current is now
