  SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -~ A
British warplane was shot down Saturday
on a NATO mission over the Muslim town
of Gorazde as the U.N.-declared safe area
appeared on the verge of falling to Bosnian
Serb forces.

  The pilot, who was trying to identify
Serb tanks shelling Gorazde, ejected after
the plane was struck by a surface-to-air mis-
sile, U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink said.
