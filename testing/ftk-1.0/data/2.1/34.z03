  These students tell the story of
adolescent sex in the 1990s. It is a
disturbing tale confirmed by coun-
selors and health professionals:
Teenagers appear to be starting
their sex lives younger, many of
them in middle school, and many are
having intercourse with multiple
partners before they finish high
school.
  This portrait emerged from re-
cent interviews with two dozen sex-
ually active teenagers from the
Washington area. Some asked not to
be named, and others asked to be
identified only by their first names.
The teenagers spanned the racial
and socioeconomic spectrum; they
included class clowns, ace students,
orchestra members and top athletes.
  In hours of interviews, the teen-
agers said they regularly have sex at
home while their parents are asleep
or away, and they frequently engage
in impromptu encounters at small
parties rife with alcohol and other
drugs. They said their sexual activi-
ty is a natural response to a sex-sat-
urated society and to crushing peer
pressure.
