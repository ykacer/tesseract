25.0 6.1 Lodi Hills (east). The visible
         workings are the Victory tungsten
         mine. Rocks are Triassic(?) volcanic
         rocks and Triassic and Jurassic sedi-
         mentary rocks intruded by a group of
         Cretaceous plutons ranging from gran-
         odiorite to granite. Tungsten and
         lead-silver deposits occur in the
         contact aureoles of the plutons.
         Beyond the Lodi Hills is the Paradise
         Range.

         road to Berlin-ichthyosaur State Park
         in the Shoshone Mountains.

32.1 1.7 Gabbs. Processing plant of Basic,
         Inc. for magnesite-brucite ores.
         Much of the magnesite is used to
         produce refactory products for
         furnaces. The magnesite and brucite
         occur in dolomite of the Triassic
         Luning Formation. In the mineralized
         area, dark fine-grained dolomite has
         been marmorized to a lighter colored,
         coarser-grained massive dolomite that
         is intergrown in varying proportions
         with magnesite. A great variety of
         dikes as well as a stock of grano-
         diorite intrude the Luning Formation
         in the vicinity of the deposit.  The
         magnesite (and recrystallized dolo-
         mite) is believed to have formed by
         the hydrothermal replacement of
         regionally metamorphosed sedimentary
         dolomite (Schilling, 1968).

         sists ofPermian(?) metavolcanic rocks
         and Triassic and Jurassic carbonate
         and clastic rocks intruded by a group
         of Cretaceous plutons and overlain by
         Miocene silicic ignimbrites and
         intermediate to silicic lavas.

           The Fairplay mining district is lo-
         cated about 8 miles to the southeast.
         Most of the mines in the Fairplay
         district are associated with epi-
