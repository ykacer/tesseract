they had acquired. After nine
months, when Father knew that the
farm project was a failure, the most
painful part for David was selling
the calf.
  When the letter arrived telling
Mother that Pa was giving up and 
coming back to Chicago, she cried,
softly and helplessly, for three days.
She, too, loved farming and had
shared my father's dreams. Now
what would become of them?
  The dreamer came back to look for
a job. He was stern with himself. "A
man must suffer," he said.
  Dave, who had been a poor stu-
dent before, now dropped out of
school and at the age of 14 persuad-
ed a recruitment officer that he was
16 and enlisted in the Army. He
served as a bugler in World War I
and, after being mustered out, grav-
itated to Texas, where he worked on
a cattle ranch.
  I was born during that war, but it
was years later that Dave again re-
turned home and I met my "true"
brother, whose heroic existence I had
shared in my dreams. I regarded
him as my "true" brother because of
my identification with his exciting
life and because my other brother,
Harry, was so much older, lived
apart from us with his own family
(including a son whom I detested),
and he simply did not seem like a
brother. How wonderful it must be, I
thought, to have a brother to play
with. All I had were sisters, and they
were no fun at all.
  My sisters assured me that Dave
had been a boy of infectious charm
and outstanding good looks, with jet
black hair and great black eyes.
What none of us knew, of course, was
that Dave had turned mean.
