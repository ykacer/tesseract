ful statement can be made about redox poten-
tial in low ionic strength ground waters
because all of the pertinent reactions are
out of equilibrium. Although Eh can be meas-
ured, the relationship of the number obtained
to any redox reaction in the solutions is
problematic at best. The analogy between Eh
and pH breaks down, these authors argue,
because there is no free electron in solution
to act as an intermediary in redox reactions
the way in which the free proton acts as the
intermediary in acid-base reactions.

The extent to which nuclear waste dissolution
reactions are controlled by Eh is still open
to debate in spite of some fairly intensive
research over the past several years. It
will be shown in this report that Eh plays an
important role in the dissolution behavior of
both technetium and uranium. The extent to
which these effects can be described quanti-
tatively and incorporated into rate equations
is still open.

4.2.1 Concepts and Definitions

Redox equilibria are described in some detail
by Garrels and Christ (1965) and Stumm and
Morgan (1981). The short section that fol-
lows sets out the needed equations and
definitions.

Redox potential is usually described by Eh, a
macroscopic parameter related to the electron
activity. Consider the analogy to pH.
