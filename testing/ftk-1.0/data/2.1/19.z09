Note that the mean I* obtained by the Reversal method
also obeys Equation (16).
  Figure 5 gives a convenient circuit and procedure for
the Direct method. While the current circuit is open, cell
emf is measured with the voltmeter in position 1 and the
desired applied voltage is set in position 2. Then the circuit
is closed and the current measured with a zero resistance
ammeter (e.g., Reference 12).
  The Direct method represents a major improvement
over the Reversal method when (E~~ - E~~) is relatively large.
An illustration of this is given in Table 3, based on
