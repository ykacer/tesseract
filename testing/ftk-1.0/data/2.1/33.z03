where my mother and father slept. I
slept on a day bed that was unfolded
nightly in the dining room.
  The great room, however, was the
parlor, which was never occupied ex-
cept by the most important visitors or
used except for state occasions, such
as the death of an aunt. It could be
looked at, but woe to me if my moth-
er caught me stepping across the in-
visible barrier that separated it from
our normal living quarters. The sight
alone, however, was an aesthetic ex-
perience of some magnitude. The fur-
niture was all bought at the store on
12th Street called Hartman's. On the
day it was acquired, we all went to
this great store, and my mother and
my sisters chose each piece after
much study and deliberation.
  I can still see this special furniture
being uncrated in our flat, with my
mother anxiously in attendance to
make certain each object was in per-
fect condition, her "jewels" from the
shana (beautiful) store.
  The rug that covered the floor was
russet with a gold border, floating
softly on the shining surface of var-
nished hardwood. A large bay win-
dow faced directly over Douglas
Park, about whose trees that radiant
light we see only in childhood slant-
ed through the Venetian blinds (they
were the latest thing) and patterned
the pale, white walls with bright hor-
izontal shafts and glowed on the 
dark, polished furnishings, the ma-
hogany sofa with its velvet uphol-
stery and the outrageously coiffured
curls that bedecked the legs of the
center table.
  Our flat was on the third floor of a
building that housed virtually every
living member of my family-~uncles
and aunts, cousins and near cousins.
