         Also, scheelite-bearing tactite
         occurs adjacent to a granitic pluton.
         In 1978, UV Industriesannounced the
         discovery in this district of 28
         million tons of rock containing 0.25%
         molybdenite with values in silver and
         copper.

37.3 2.6 Junction with Poleline Road to
         Tonopah.

         FMC's Paradise Peak Deposit is
         located approximately 4.5 miles east
         on the Poleline Road.

         Mineral County.

43.8 1.8 The Rex mercury occurrence is located
         on the left (east).  Mercury occurs
         in Tertiary intermediate volcanics.
         The mineralization is associated with
         silicification, argillization, and
         native sulfur, and is similar to the
         gold mineralization at the Paradise
         Peak deposit. The first rock-chip
         sample was taken at the Rex mercury
         occurrence, and led to FMC's dis-
         covery of the Paradise Peak orebody.

44.8 1.0 Road to Rawhide on west side of high-
         way.

         The Rawhide gold-silver deposit is a
         joint-venture project between Kenne-
         cott Corp., Plexus Inc,. and Klewit
         Mining Group Inc. The deposit has 24
         million tons of ore of current mine-
         able reserves which average .045 oz/T
         Au and .47 oz/T Ag. The ore is amen-
         able to heap-leach processing and
         mining will be an open pit operation.

         The gold mineralization occurs in
         Tertiary volcanics and is concen-
         trated on the east edge of a small
