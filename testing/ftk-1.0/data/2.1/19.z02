given by ba' = 2.303 RT/(1 ~ ~')F, with the values of ~' as
shown on the curves (~ = transfer coefficient, n = number
of electrons, and ~ = stoichiometric number).
  An important characteristic demonstrated in Figure 4 is
that the error from the linear polarization assumption is
asymmetric, i.e., greater for anodic polarization than for
cathodic or vice versa, except for the 0.5 curve (ba' =
|bc"|). The asymmetry can be very pronounced, as shown
numerically in Table 2. Listed here is the maximum value
of E ~ E~, below which the linear polarization error remains
less than 5%. The maximum ~E is seen to vary consider-
ably, from 6 to 57 mV, as the anodic Tafel slope is
changed.
