In short: Available in both DOS and Windows versions,
ACT! enjoys a continuing popularity that is well de-
served. Novices can use either package straight out
of the box with little setup, and more experienced users
can customize their look and feel. The logical, clean
user interface makes data entry and searches easy,
and additional features simplify making and recording
phone calls, writing letters, sending faxes, and compil-
ing reports to get an overview of contact history.
