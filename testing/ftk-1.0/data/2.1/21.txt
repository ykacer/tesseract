New Jersey roots.

action for all of 1993

Jersey Jim

At the Shell Houston Open, Jim
McGovern became the first New
Jersey pro to win on the PGA
Tour since Wes Ellis in 1965.
True to his roots, the 28-year-old
McGovern has no plans to move
to a warmer climate. Even though
the temperature dips below freez-
ing as early as November,
McGovern enjoys Jersey winters.
  "I like the change of seasons,
that's probably the best thing,"
says McGovern. "My family still
lives in the area. It's home, all my
friends are there."
  You might find McGovern
playing pickup hoops or taking
cuts with the local softball team
when he's home in Oradell, the
town that also produced football
coach Bill Parcells and McGov-
ern's brother Rob, an NFL line-
backer. McGovern could have
played college football himself,
but chose golf instead. While it
was a longshot for a guy from the
Garden State to make it on the
PGA Tour, it's proven to be a
wise decision.




On the sidelines

This season is another washout for
Scott Verplank, once the nation's
most promising young golfer.
Verplank underwent a second
surgery on his right elbow last No-
vember, a year after the first. As
of this spring, he still couldn't
straighten the arm.
  "My career is absolutely in
jeopardy, so I'm not going to
jeopardize it any more by trying to
come back too soon," says Ver-
plank, 28. That means, at best, he
would be ready for the Qualifying
School this winter.
  Playing hurt has been one of
Verplank's problems. He made
only one of 26 cuts in 1991 before
he knew the severity of his elbow
problem; last year, he made just
one of 13 cuts after surgery for
bone spurs, which proved to be
only a partial solution. The most
recent surgery was to increase the
blood flow to his elbow.
  "I haven't watched golf on tele-
vision," Verplank reports of his
down time. "I would rather be
doing it than watching it."
