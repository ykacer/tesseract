Father

purported to be cleared for farming
and graced with a house and a well.
  Father and David said farewell to
my mother and to the children:
Harry, David's elder brother, and
Anne, Mary, and Rose. They depart-
ed by train with a huge trunk, large-
ly filled with tools, and with a supply
of tremendous sandwiches and a con-
tainer of tea adequate for the three-
day journey through the plains of Illi-
nois, the hills of Tennessee and the
pine wilderness of the deep South.
  Foley lies south of Mobile, within
25 miles of the Gulf of Mexico. Upon
their arrival, Father and Dave went
to the sheriff's office, where they
found a kindly man who addressed
them with a German accent. Since
Father could speak German, a warm
relationship sprang up between the
two men.
  The first things my father needed,
the sheriff told him, were a horse and
wagon. Yes, he knew exactly where
both might be purchased. The price
was $80, and since the mare was in
foal, my father thought this a bargain.
  Guided by the sheriff, they fol-
lowed a dirt country road eight miles
to the farm. There, Pa discovered
that instead of 60 acres being
cleared, as represented, only 10 were
suitable for farming. Nevertheless,
he set about putting in a crop of
peas, for which the sheriff assured
him there was a ready market in
Pensacola, Fla., 30 miles distant.
  He also went to work on the house,
adding to one side of it and building
a screened-in bedroom for David.
  He cut down a large tree and
scooped out the inside of the trunk so
it could be filled with water as a
horse trough. He bought chickens
and planted peas, corn and lettuce.
Once, he thought he had located a
supply of wild lettuce, which he
made into a sumptuous salad, only
to discover after the first bite that it
was tobacco!
   
  AIDED BY DAVE AND THE
  horse, Pa worked
  from morning to
  night, then relaxed
  by reading, in the
light of a kerosene lamp, one of the
three books he brought with him: one
contained the essays of Charles Lamb
and Robert Louis Stevenson, another
consisted of lectures on evolution by
Charles Darwin, and the third was a
Yiddish book of fairy tales.
  Almost from the first, my father
recognized the hopelessness of it.
Surrounded by forest and under-
brush that would take years to clear,
