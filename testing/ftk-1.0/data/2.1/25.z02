  The reference section contains a sequence of clastic or evaporative rock
formations with varying permeabilities and porosities. These water-bearing
formations contain and transmit various quantities of groundwater, depending
upon the regional gradient and certain hydrogeological parameters such as
porosity, permeability, and formation thickness. The values for these parameters
vary considerably from site to site. The ranges of values obtained from the
literature search and past experience are listed in Table V.

2.2. Repository and inventory

  For this study the repository size is based on the area required to dispose
of the wastes produced by a nuclear economy with a capacity of 100 GW(e),
operating at this level for one year. Under this assumption the area covered by
the repository would be about 30 ha; this would require about 15 tunnels for
storing HLW, MLW and LLW.
  The assumed waste packages are stainless steel canisters (30 cm i.d. and
300 cm long for HLW), steel canisters (86 cm i.d. and 115 cm long for cladding
wastes), and 200-litre carbon steel drums, shielded (20 cm concrete) or unshielded.
