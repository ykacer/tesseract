25.0 6.1 Lodi Hills (east). The visible
         workings are the Victory tungsten
         mine. Rocks are Triassic(?) volcanic
         rocks and Triassic and Jurassic sedi-
         mentary rocks intruded by a group of
         Cretaceous plutons ranging from gran-
         odiorite to granite. Tungsten and
         lead-silver deposits occur in the
         contact aureoles of the plutons.
         Beyond the Lodi Hills is the Paradise
         Range.

30.4 5.4 Intersection with State Route 91, the
         road to Berlin-ichthyosaur State Park
         in the Shoshone Mountains.

32.1 1.7 Gabbs. Processing plant of Basic,
         Inc. for magnesite-brucite ores.
         Much of the magnesite is used to
         produce refactory products for
         furnaces. The magnesite and brucite
         occur in dolomite of the Triassic
         Luning Formation. In the mineralized
         area, dark fine-grained dolomite has
         been marmorized to a lighter colored,
         coarser-grained massive dolomite that
         is intergrown in varying proportions
         with magnesite. A great variety of
         dikes as well as a stock of grano-
         diorite intrude the Luning Formation
         in the vicinity of the deposit.  The
         magnesite (and recrystallized dolo-
         mite) is believed to have formed by
         the hydrothermal replacement of
         regionally metamorphosed sedimentary
         dolomite (Schilling, 1968).

33.2 1.0 The City of Gabbs.

34.7 1.5 The Paradise Range on the left con-
         sists ofPermian(?) metavolcanic rocks
         and Triassic and Jurassic carbonate
         and clastic rocks intruded by a group
         of Cretaceous plutons and overlain by
         Miocene silicic ignimbrites and
         intermediate to silicic lavas.

           The Fairplay mining district is lo-
         cated about 8 miles to the southeast.
         Most of the mines in the Fairplay
         district are associated with epi-




         thermal precious metal deposits in
         Tertiary volcanic rocks.

         Also, scheelite-bearing tactite
         occurs adjacent to a granitic pluton.
         In 1978, UV Industriesannounced the
         discovery in this district of 28
         million tons of rock containing 0.25%
         molybdenite with values in silver and
         copper.

37.3 2.6 Junction with Poleline Road to
         Tonopah.

         FMC's Paradise Peak Deposit is
         located approximately 4.5 miles east
         on the Poleline Road.

42.0 4.7 Nye/Mineral County Line, entering
         Mineral County.

43.8 1.8 The Rex mercury occurrence is located
         on the left (east).  Mercury occurs
         in Tertiary intermediate volcanics.
         The mineralization is associated with
         silicification, argillization, and
         native sulfur, and is similar to the
         gold mineralization at the Paradise
         Peak deposit. The first rock-chip
         sample was taken at the Rex mercury
         occurrence, and led to FMC's dis-
         covery of the Paradise Peak orebody.

44.8 1.0 Road to Rawhide on west side of high-
         way.

         The Rawhide gold-silver deposit is a
         joint-venture project between Kenne-
         cott Corp., Plexus Inc,. and Klewit
         Mining Group Inc. The deposit has 24
         million tons of ore of current mine-
         able reserves which average .045 oz/T
         Au and .47 oz/T Ag. The ore is amen-
         able to heap-leach processing and
         mining will be an open pit operation.
         (Skillings' Mining Review, April
         1986).

         The gold mineralization occurs in
         Tertiary volcanics and is concen-
         trated on the east edge of a small
