CHAPTER VI: HISTORY OF BONNEVILLE BASIN.-~Previous to the Bonneville history the basin was
	arid. The first rise of the lake was without overflow, and was long maintained ; the Yellow Clay
	was then deposited. The second rise went 90 feet higher, causing overflow, but was of shorter
	duration; the White Marl was then deposited. The final drying divided the basin into a dozen
	independent basins, the largest of which contains Great Salt Lake. Since 1845 that lake has
	repeatedly risen and fallen through a range of 10 feet.-~The history of Lake Bonneville is par-
	alleled by that of Lake Lahontan, and each is connected with a history of glaciation in adjacent
	mountains. This connection, the depauperation of the fossil shells, and an analysis of the climatic
	conditions of glaciation, lead to the conclusion that the lacustrine epochs were epochs of relative
	cold.
CHAPTER VII: LAKE BONNEVILLE AND VOLCANIC ERUPTION.-~The group of small craters and basaltic
	lava fields near Fillmore, Utah, are closely related to the lake history. Some eruptions took place
	beneath the water of the lake, others since its disappearance, and others again during the inter-
	lacustrine epoch.-~Numerous basaltic eruptions occurred in the lake area before the lake period,
	and at still earlier dates rhyolite was extravasated.
CHAPTER VIII: LAKE BONNEVILLE AND DIASTROPHISM.-~Orogenic change during a period subsequent
	to the lake is shown by fault scarps. The formation of fault scarps is accompanied by earth-
	quakes.-~Epeirogenic change during a period subsequent to the lake is shown by the deformation
	of the planes of the shore-lines. Under the postulate that the doming of the planes is due to the
	drying away of the lake, it is conclu~~~ that the strains induced by the unloading of the areas
	exceeded the elastic limit of the material and caused viscous distortion of the earth's crust.
	This result, taken in connection with the phenomena of mountain uplift, leads to an estimate of
	the strength of the crust.
CHAPTE~ IX: AGE OF THE EQUUS FAUNA.-~The Equus fauna at its type locality is contained in lake
	beds correlated by physical relations with the uppermost of the Lahontan and Bonneville beds,
	The fauna, previously called later Pliocene, is thus shown to have lived in late Pleistocene time.
