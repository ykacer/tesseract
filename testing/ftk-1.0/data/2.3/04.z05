  Jim, better known as the Washing-
ton-based half of PBS's Emmy-win-
ning MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, is
an old hand at this sort of barnstorm-
ing and all too familiar with its lone-
lier aspects. But last winter, inspira-
tion struck. "I felt, `My goodness,
if I could work out a deal where Kate
goes with me, I'll have my cake and
eat it too,' " says Jim, at home with
Kate in their five-bedroom gray stuc-
co home in Washington's comfort-
able Cleveland Park neighborhood.
