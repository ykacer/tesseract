135~ West Longitude. A second data set of just the NTS area for the
time period 1969-1972 was obtained from U.S.G.S. This set contained
seismic events detected and located using stations of the U.S.G.S.,
Sandia Laboratories, Incorporated, and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory local
seismograph networks. A third data set was obtained from the U.S.G.S.
which covered a section of central California along the San Andreas Fault
where they employ a dense network of seismograph stations.
  Perspective plots of the earthquake strain release for the California/
Nevada area were prepared for one-year periods between 1950 and 1973 and
for ten-year periods 1933-1942 through 1963-1972. These plots represent
the cumulative strain release for each of 1,760 1/4~ by 1/4~ grid units
between 32.5~ nd 42.5~ North Latitude and 113.5~ and 124.5~ West Longi-
tude. In an earlier report (Willis and others, 1973), similar plots were
published for the Nevada area extending back to 1852. Trends of earthquake
activity are clearly visible on these perspective plots but no pattern of
migration could be detected in the seismic activity. Nor could short term
increases or changes in seismic activity be detected beyond the NTS area
that would correlate with the NTS testing program.
  Cross-correlation of the 1956 strain release data (a year which
contained no significant underground nuclear tests) with the strain
release data for each year between 1950 and 1973 indicated a reoccurrence
every 5 to 6 years of high maximum correlation coefficients. This may
be due to the reoccurrence of one or more major earthquakes in the same
grid unit. As with the visual analysis, no correlations were observed
with the NTS activity.
