ductility than Type 316 and 347, and almost the same hot duc-
tility with Type 304 as shown in Figures 13 and ~4.
  Susceptibilities to hot cracking in welding were also ex-
amined by Varestraint and hot tear tests, show~ ~n Figures 15,
16, and 17. The susceptibility to hot cracking o~ 347LP is much
lower than those of Type 310, 316, 316L, and 3~~ and almost
similar to those of Type 304 and 304L, as show~ ~ Figures 18
and 19. The hot cracking criteria of weld meta~ ~ ndicated as
the function of Ni and Cr equivalents, as show~ ~ Figure 20.
The chemical composition of 347LP is in the noncracking
region.
