These results appear to be quite different from those of Addison, Gamlen and
Thompson103 who find that unlike nitrite and nitrate, hyponitrite and oxyhypo-
nitrite (Na2N2O~) are immediately oxidized by liquid nitrogen dioxide.
  The explosive decomposition of triethylammonium nitrate and nitrogen dioxide
mixtures has been mentioned104 and the reaction of sodamide with nitrogen dioxide
in carbon tetrachloride solution has been shown to result in the production of the
amidonitrate.105

		The Action of Nitrogen Dioxide on Metals

  Nitrogen dioxide readily attacks many metals and several papers describing such
reactions are of a technical nature. Earlier work indicated that nitrogen dioxide
attacks iron and copper,106, 107 and it was later suggested108 that in the case of
copper the product is the oxide, Cu2O. With mercury the products of reaction were
thought to be mercurous nitrite and mercuric nitrite.154 Recently109 the reaction has
been shown to be represented by the equation:
