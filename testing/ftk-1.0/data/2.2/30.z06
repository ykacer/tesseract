Your AT&T Long Distance Service Agreement

Remember to endorse your check before cashing it.  Your signature on this check authorizes AT&T to process your order and notify
your local telephone company of your decision to switch to AT&T Dial-1 Long Distance Service. (Dial-1 Service refers to the long distance
service you use when you dial 1 + area code + number from your home telephone.)
Your local telephone company may charge you a fee to switch your long distance service.  If so, it will appear on a future telephone bill.
Your selection of AT&T will apply only to the telephone number listed on the front of this check.
