variations in measured permeabilities in jointed
rocks, reflecting dependence upon the cube of
variable aperture. The dispersions of principal
axes (Plate 1, Figures 3 and 5) and perme-
abilities (Plate 1, Figures 4 and 6) decrease
for samples of increasing size (100 and 500
joints, respectively), as anticipated from the
central limit theorem. Principal axes are con-
centrated within about 10~ and 5~ of are for
the 100 and 500 conduit samples, respec-
tively. Median permeability values increase
slightly with sample size as shown in the sum-
mary plot (Figure 2). Studies have indicated
that model permeability is well-defined for 100
or more joints; otherwise it is a function of size.
  The stereographic projections of principal
axes display three of the quantities required to
define a second rank tensor, and the cumulative
permeability plots display the other three. Thus
each pair of plots should be read together. Cer-
tain mutual relationships are evident. If two
principal permeabilities are nearly the same
each time a sample is taken, then their axial
orientations are sensitive to differences in the
conductors in the samples. Since any two equal
orthogonal permeability vectors define a plane
of isotropy, we find that successive solutions for
a single set of dispersed joint orientations scatter
orientations throughout a great circle of the
stereonet, such as the equatorial planes of Fig-
ures 3 and 5 of Plate 1. The normal to the plane
of isotropy is the only unique principal axis, as
is the optic axis of a uniaxial mineral. Figures
4 and 6 of Plate 1 show slight differences be-
tween principal permeabilities on the isotropic
plane (maximum and intermediate permeabili-
ties), whereas the intermingling of diamonds
and circles on the girdle in the stereogram indi-
cates statistical isotropy, especially for large
samples.
  Sheeted granite is a prototype of a single
set of joints. Plate 2 illustrates the effect of de-
creasing orientation dispersion of a single set of
joints. The joint populations for Fisher's K~ =
6 to 60 are shown, as well as the principal axes
and permeabilities for samples of size 92 to 106,
varying according to equation 26 to maintain a
sample volume of 1035 cm cubed for a jointed
medium of inverse specific surface 10 cm. As
orientation dispersion decreases, there is pro-
gressive reduction of the dispersion of axes and
permeabilities, diminution of the minor perme-
