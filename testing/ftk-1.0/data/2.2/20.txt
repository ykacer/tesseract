  Properties.  The Clifford mine is the only property in the dis-
trict. It is owned by the Western Gold Corporation, represented
by W. B. Naismith of Tonopah.  The property came into the pres-
ent ownership in 1925 and was operated intermittently by the
company and lessees until 1946.27 Mineral Resources reports 
the shipment of 260 tons of ore containing 2 ounces gold and 4
ounces silver per ton from Clifford to the Millers mill in 1930. In
1941 and 1946, part of the dumps were shipped to a smelter. The
property has been idle since 1946.
  The workings consist of two vertical shafts, one 300 feet deep,
the other 400 feet in depth. Both have headframes and one has a
hoist. Water stands at the 300-foot level in the deeper shaft.
  E. M. Booth of Tonopah was one of the last successful lessees
at the property.  He states that the ore zone is 100-125 feet by
70 feet and the ore occurs in this zone as pipes and bunches.
Although the values are usually in silver as the chloride, some
high-grade bunches of gold ore have also been found. 

          CLOVERDALE (Black Springs, Golden, Republic)
  The Cloverdale district includes the southern part of the Sho-
shone Mountains from the Cloverdale Ranch at the southern tip
to about 8 miles north, including both East and West Golden. The 
district also includes the area near the Orizaba mine, which is on
a spur off the northern Cedar Mountains and is about 5 miles air
line southwest of the Cloverdale Ranch.
  The district is about 40 miles by road from either Tonopah or
Mina. Condition of the routes depends on the part of the district;
from East Golden and Cloverdale the route to Tonopah is usually
preferred, while from the Orizaba section the Mina road is ordi-
narily in better condition. Water may be obtained from several 
springs in the area usually within a short distance of the prop-
erties.  The California Electric Company's line to Gabbs passes
between the Cloverdale Ranch and the Orizaba mine and is there-
fore within a short distance of the mining properties.
  Geology.  Tertiary volcanics cover all of the southern part of
the Shoshone Mountains and much of that part of the Cedar
Mountains included in the district. Triassic limestone and dolo-
mite of the Luning formation28 is exposed over a large area of the
