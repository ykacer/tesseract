As in the case of stresses acting on edge dislocations, choice
of ~ or - in Eq. 8.14 depends on the sign of the dislocation
(i.e., whether the screw is left-handed or right-handed).
  The dependence of the direction of the force exerted
by a shear stress on the sign of both edge and screw
dislocations implies that the dislocation loop shown in
Fig. 8.6 can be made to expand uniformly in the radial
direction by a shear force in the direction of the arrow in
the drawing. The x-direction force exerted on the edge
component at A is ~~xyb, and the edge component at C is
subject to a force -~xyb. Similarly, the y-direction forces
on the screw components at B and D are ~~xyb and -~~xyb,
respectively.
  Tensile or compressive stresses produce no force on a
screw dislocation, which is incapable of movement by
climb.

8.5 MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES OF
    DISLOCATIONS

8.5.1 Density of Dislocation Lines

  The concentration of dislocation lines in a solid is
measured by the number of dislocation lines that penetrate
a unit area within the crystal. This quantity, which is
known as the dislocation density, ranges from ~104
dislocations cm2 in high-purity carefully prepared semicon-
ductor single crystals (germanium or silicon) to ~1011
