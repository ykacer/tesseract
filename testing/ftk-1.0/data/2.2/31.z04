The choice of ~ign ~or direction) of the force depends on
whether the e~tra ~heet of atoms forming the dislocation is
inserted from above or below the slip plane in Fig. 8.10a.
  Figure ~.10b shows the force exerted on an edge
dislocation due to an applied tensile stress that acts in a
plane parallel to the slip plane and normal to the
dislocation line. By arguments similar to that used above
for applied ~hear stresses, the resulting force on the
dislocation is found to be ~~~~ and in a direction
perpendicular to the slip plane. The sign depends on
whether the extra sheet of atoms is above or below the slip
plane in Fig. 8.10b. The sign also depends on the type of
normal stress. If the normal stress is tensile, the force is
directed away from the extra sheet of atoms forming the
edge dislocation (this case is shown in Fig. 8.10b~. A
compressive stress tends to drive the dislocation line in the
opposite direction.
  In a stress field consisting of both normal and shear
components, the vector force on a unit length edge
dislocation is given by
