is reversible at approximately 400~. It appears that certain nitrites are not affected
by liquid dinitrogen tetroxide,47 and that the oxidation to nitrate which occurs at
high temperature is in fact due to atomic oxygen produced by collision of the nitrogen
dioxide molecules with the surface of the nitrite, yielding nitric oxide at the same
time. Any nitrite which decomposes may appear to react, owing to the reaction of
the products of the decomposition.102
  The induced decomposition of hyponitrites has been reported to take place at 0~
in the presence of nitrogen dioxide.102 The reactions that occur are those found in
the thermal decomposition of hyponitrites:
