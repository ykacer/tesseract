(Figure 2c), an area of stagnant water is
formed. A high accumulation of mineral con-
stituents is probable at these places. Below such
a stagnant body of groundwater, flow occurs
again and may result in a better quality of
water than that from shallower depths.
  7. Decreasing potential with depth in re-
charge areas and increasing potential in dis-
charge areas are direct consequences of the the-
ory and can be observed in all diagrams of
Figure 2. It should be noted, however, that such
a configuration of the equipotential lines is pro-
nounced only in the immediate vicinities of the
highs and lows. The midlines and their vicinities
are locations of relatively straight, vertical equi-
potential lines.
  8. From Figure 2 it can safely be stated that
the major stream of the basin receives ground-
water contributions only from the adjacent
topographic highs and from possible regional
flow. The latter is probably unimportant in
most cases because of the low rate of flow. It
is conceivable, then, that the methods in which
baseflow data are used for computation of basin-
wide characteristics (average recharge, permea-
bility, etc.) are misleading or erroneous. Even
