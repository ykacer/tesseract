Need for Thermal Analysis

  Many aspects of waste package design and testing depend in part on the
temperature environment to which the emplaced packages will be exposed.
Information produced by thermal analysis is needed for the following reasons.

~	To demonstrate that designs will not exceed maximum temperature
	criteria for the various waste forms: 773 K (500~C) for Defense High
	Level Waste (DHLW) glass, 673 K (400~C) for Commercial High Level
	Waste (CHLW) glass, and 623 K (350~C) for Spent Fuel (SF);

~	To provide projected temperature ~istories for materials selection;

~	To assist in the verification of the performance analysis code, WAPPA
	[1];*

~	To provide temperature boundary conditions for the performance
	analysis code;

~	To provide the temperature environment for transportation, handling,
	storage and retrieval analyses;

~	To calculate approximate time periods of steam/water contact with
	waste package;

~	To provide temperature histories for corrosion testing;

~	To provide temperature ~istories for waste form leach testing;

~	To provide temperature histories and boundary conditions for very
	near field steam/air/water porous flow calculations;
