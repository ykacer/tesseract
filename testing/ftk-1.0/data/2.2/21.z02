dispersed joints have been modeled [Snow,
1965], a few examples of which are shown here
in stereograhic projections. Systems of any
desired complexity can be generated by com-
bining individual dispersions differing in direc-
tion of central tendency, dispersion coefficient,
or spacing. Plate 1 shows the change of aniso-
tropy for a single set having a given dispersion
as the sample size changes. Plate 2 shows the
effect of decreasing orientation dispersion from
Fisher's K~ = 6 to 60. Plate 3 treats two ortho-
gonal sets, Plate 4 two nonorthogonal sets, and
Plate 5 three orthogonal sets.
  In any one model, spacing has been main-
tained by proportioning the sample size of each
set according to equation 26 and Figure 5.
  Also displayed in stereographic projection are
the principal permeability axes for 49 sampl-
ings, disclosing the range of possible solutions.
Orthogonal triplets of diamonds, circles, and
crosses correspond to maximum, intermediate,
and minimum permeability axes. The scatter
simulates the variation in principal permeability
axes that must exist from one place to another
in jointed rock. The axes close on mean direc-
tions as the sample size or volume increases.
Dispersion of the axes would be concealed by
mean values, using only large samples. Note
that aberrant axial orientations are possible
from a random model, as illustrated in Plate 1,
Figure 3, by the minor axis (cross) oriented
N 78~W, 30~ from the vertical. If a sample
contains one large opening it will dominate the
directional permeability just as an open fault
will dominate the flow in a region.
  Distribution curves of principal permeabili-
ties are plotted. Diamonds, circles, and crosses
maintain correspondence of principal axes and
permeabilities. Since the maximum, interme-
diate, and minimum permeabilities were ranked
separately for cumulatve plotting, the three
values found at any one ordinate do not con-
stitute a particular solution. To preserve in-
dividual relationships, on the right of the
permeability plots the cumulative distribution
of maximum anisotropies has been plotted, each
being the ratio of minimum permeability to
maximum permeability for a particular solu-
tion.
  The dispersion of principal permeabilities is
portrayed in Plate 1. The large dispersions com-
puted are consistent with the large observed
