I. INTRODUCTION

  The Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations (NNWSI) are evaluating
the suitability of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) for location of a high-level
radioactive waste repository. Current geologic exploration studies within the
NTS are focused on Yucca Mountain (Dixon et al. 1980), a large fault block
composed of multiple sequences of ash-flow tuff erupted from the Timber
Mountain-Oasis Valley cauldron complex (Byers et al. 1976).
  Yucca Mountain is located within the south-central Great Basin, a physio-
graphic subprovince of the larger Basin and Range Province, which includes
much of the western United States. The Great Basin is a tectonically active re-
gion. Its geologic history is characterized by extensional block faulting
that produced linear mountain ranges separated by broad alluvial basins (Nolan
1943; Stewart 1978; Christiansen and McKee 1978). This faulting was closely
associated in time and space with silicic volcanic activity at major cauldron
complexes. Silicic volcanic rocks as old as 40 to 45 Myr are present in the
central Great Basin. Younger volcanic rocks occur within broadly arcuate
belts that are successively younger to the south and toward the margins of the
Great Basin (Armstrong et al. 1969; Scott et al. 1971; Noble 1972; Stewart and
Carlson 1978). Silicic rocks of late Miocene age are most abundant within an
east-west-trending belt of the south-central Great Basin. This belt extends
from southeastern Nevada through the NTS region and may bend to the northwest
along the Walker Lane structural trend (Stewart and Carlson 1978). Since about
14 Myr ago, two major changes in the patterns of tectonic and volcanic activ-
ity have occurred. First, there has been a progressive concentration of tec-
tonic activity toward the margins of the Great Basin (Scholtz et al. 1971;
