The pressure drops on the fracture for a uniform
flux fracture and for an infinite-conductivity fracture
are obtained by evaluating Eq. 29 at xD = 0 and
~D = 0.732, respectively. The choice of the same
point as in the infinite case leads to reasonable
results and can be justified a posteriori by the
method of desuperposition, presented later in this
paper. Numerical values of the dimensionless
