1963 (see Table 2) and is not included in the consumptive use shown. Water
added to the tanks was adjusted for changes in soil moisture during the month.
The depth to water was held between 5 and 6 ft below land surface.
   As a result of the general increase of vegetation in each of the tanks,
water use during 1964 greatly exceeded that used during 1963. The pattern of
vegetation development was not the same for each tank, however, so the rela-
tion between data for pairs of individual tanks was continually changing. In
1965, the plants were approaching maturity, and the volume of vegetation
increased only slightly.
   A search of the literature indicated that water-use data for arrowweed
were lacking prior to the current studies at Yuma. The data now available
indicate that under favorable conditions, arrowweed will use as much water
as saltcedar, which has long been known for its high rate of water use.
   Saltbush.-~Quailbrush (Atriplex lentiformis) was grown in tanks 1 and 2,
and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) was grown in tank 3. The salt-
bush was established both by transplanting and seeding. Depth to water was
held at 3 to 4 ft below land surface, in 1962, and nearly constant at 5.5 ft
during 1963 and 1964.
   The quailbrush made most of its growth during 1963, the average volume
of the two tanks increasing from 1,050 cu ft in December, 1962, to 5,650 cu
ft in October, 1963. Although the average volume of vegetation increased to
6,240 cu ft by September, 1964, and 7,030 by August 6, 1965, the volume of
foliage actively transpiring may have been less (see Fig. 3). Growth in tank
1 was more vigorous than in tank 2 during 1964. The consumptive use, shown
in Table 8, does not include precipitation but is adjusted for soil-moisture
changes during the month.
   Four-wing saltbush, grown in tank 3, is smaller and slower in growth than
quailbrush. This plant will exist as a xerophyte, but appears to grow and pro-
duce seed only when moisture is sufficient to meet minimum needs. The
greatest growth of vegetation in the tank was made during 1963, when the
volume increased from 1,290 to 2,290 cu ft. The volume was 2,770 cu ft on
September 24, 1964, and 3,080 on August 6, 1965. The water use, shown in
Table 8 and Fig. 4, was significantly less during 1964 and 1965, essentially
because of the maturation of the plants.
   Cattail.-~Cattail grows to maturity and dies each season. In the Yuma
area, growth begins in March and ends in July; vegetation begins to dies in
October and usually is dry by December. The tanks for cattail were set well
within an extensive area of similar vegetation. Cattail transplanted late in
the 1961 growing season made little growth during the remainder of the year.
During 1962 and following years, however, the cattail grew normally in th~
tanks, attaining an average height of 6 to 7 ft each year.
   Water was added to the tanks at least twice each week, reestablishing th~
water level at a point 2 to 4 in. above the roots of the plants. Water w~~
changed once each week to prevent the accumulation of salts. Except for ~~~
vegetation in tank 3 during 1964, as will be explained subsequently, cat~~~~~
in the tanks blended well with that of the surrounding area (see Fig. 5).
   Consumptive use from tank 1 showed no progressive increase or decre~~~
during the 3 yr, as indicated by Table 9 and Fig. 6. The appearance o~~~~~
vegetation was about the same each year. The condition of the vegeta~~~~~~~
tank 2 was noticeably improved during 1964 relative to previous years, ~~~ 
the higher use from this tank during 1964 is associated with this change. ~~~
