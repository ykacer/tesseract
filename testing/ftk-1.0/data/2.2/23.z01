transition in mantle source regions through time
may be indicated by a transition from normal to Rb-
depleted, Sr-enriched hawaiites in the younger
basaltic cycles. The recurrence of small volumes
of hawaiite magma at Crater Flat supports assump-
tions required for probability modeling of future
volcanic activity and provides a basis for esti-
mating the effects of volcanic disruption of a
repository site in the southwestern Nevada Test
Site region. Preliminary data suggest that succes-
sive basalt cycles at Crater Flat may be of de-
creasing volume but recurring more frequently.
