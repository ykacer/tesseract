                    water flow [after Back, 1960].




(Figure 2c), an area of stagnant water is
formed. A high accumulation of mineral con-
stituents is probable at these places. Below such
a stagnant body of groundwater, flow occurs
again and may result in a better quality of
water than that from shallower depths.
  7. Decreasing potential with depth in re-
charge areas and increasing potential in dis-
charge areas are direct consequences of the the-
ory and can be observed in all diagrams of
Figure 2. It should be noted, however, that such
a configuration of the equipotential lines is pro-
nounced only in the immediate vicinities of the
highs and lows. The midlines and their vicinities
are locations of relatively straight, vertical equi-
potential lines.
  8. From Figure 2 it can safely be stated that
the major stream of the basin receives ground-
water contributions only from the adjacent
topographic highs and from possible regional
flow. The latter is probably unimportant in
most cases because of the low rate of flow. It
is conceivable, then, that the methods in which
baseflow data are used for computation of basin-
wide characteristics (average recharge, permea-
bility, etc.) are misleading or erroneous. Even




if the two flanks of a basin are of low relief, ~
that there are no local systems, the bulk of t~
basin discharge will take place between the mi~
line and the valley bottom and only a small po~
tion will appear as baseflow.
  9. A further consequence of the theory 
that the water levels at shallow depths are t~
most affected by seasonal recharge and d~
charge. The small intake and outlet areas of t~
intermediate and regional zones prevent t~
water levels from fluctuating widely. Plotnik~
and Bogomolov [1958, p. 90] make a distin~
tion between two zones on the basis of fluctu~
tion of the water levels. They call the first `zo~
of oscillations of underground water levels.' A~
cording to them the volume of water that occ~
pies the zone of oscillation undergoes season
variations. This volume would control groun~
water discharge and therefore they call it `co~
trol reserves of underground waters.' Their se~
ond zone includes all the water that is below th
zone of oscillation, both that in the deeper, st~
homogeneous parts of the basin and that i
artesian aquifers; these are the `secular r~
sources.' It seems that the `zone of oscillatio~
and the portion of the `secular resources' th~
