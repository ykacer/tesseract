  SAN FRANCISCO - On the morning after,
  or even as late as five days after unpro-
  tected sex, 150 women will walk one by
  one into a room at San Francisco General
  Hospital, swallow up to three white pills
and become the first Americans to test the French
abortion drug, RU-486, as an emergency contracep-
tive.
  Calling the clinical trials "a new era in reproduc-
tive research for women," Dr. David A. Grimes, the
principal investigator, said that if the landmark
study is successful, RU-486 or a similar drug could
reduce the need for abortion.
  "And that's a cause everyone should rally around
regardless of their beliefs," said Grimes, who began
last week searching for volunteers. In the first 24
hours after the study's announcement Tuesday, 80
women called before his clogged answering machine
automatically shut down.
  According to the nurse who is screening volun-
teers, the callers are married as well as single, and
range in age from 18 through their 40s. They tell of
broken condoms and moments of passion that made
them skip birth control "just this once."
  But even as some women clamored for the drug,
which has not been approved for marketing in the
United States, Richard Glasow of the antiabortion
National Right to Life Committee, said women were
being misled into thinking of RU-486 as an emergen-
cy contraceptive, when in fact it is an abortion pill.
  "The proposed testing of RU-486 as a contracep-
tive is fundamentally misleading," Glasow said, "be-
cause it works not to prevent contraception but to
cause abortion."
  Glasow and many other opponents of abortion
maintain that human life begins the moment the
sperm joins with the egg.
  However, Grimes, professor of obstetrics and gy-
necology at the University of California at San Fran-
cisco, said that most scientists consider a woman
pregnant when a fertilized egg becomes implanted in
her uterus, which occurs up to two weeks after fertil-
ization. Thus, very early use of the drug would be
preventing, not ending, pregnancy.
  "The pill works before pregnancy has started,"
Grimes said.
  Glasow said that researchers in this study were
attempting to repackage RU-486 as a contraceptive
to help promote the drug's legalization in the United
States.
