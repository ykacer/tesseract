others, 1976) as owing to magmatic resurgence with uplift
of the cauldron block from its former subsided position
(diagram 4, fig. 26). The entire Paintbrush cauldron later
participated in a broad magmatic doming  preliminary to
the culminating stages of volcanism-~the eruption of ash-
flow sheets of the Timber Mountain Tuff. Quartz-bearing
pre-Rainier Mesa rhyolite lavas were extruded from
fractures probably related to this broad doming (diagram
5, fig. 26). Gas-charged silicic rhyolitic magma
accumulated at the top of the domical chamber, and tuffs
were assimilated from the roof as crystallization proceeded
lower in the chamber.
  The Timber Mountain Tuff chapter of the caldera
complex began 11.3 m.y. ago with eruption of the
voluminous Rainier Mesa Member from the central part of
the broad dome that had formed over the magma chamber.
The domed roof over the magma chamber ruptured
sufficiently to cause a considerable reduction of pressure
and to trigger vesiculation which greatly increased the
volume of the gas-charged magma escaping through
fissures. As the eruption proceeded, collapse of the roof
occurred, and the Rainier Mesa accumulated to a greater
thickness inside the subsidence area than outside (diagram
6, fig. 26). As the caldera deepened with continuing
eruption a more crystal-rich, but less gas-charged, quartz
latitic magma was tapped, whose eruptions were largely
confined within the caldera. Poorly sorted debris flows
containing large blocks of welded tuff and lava slid off the
newly formed oversteepened caldera walls and inter-
tongued with the upper quartz latitic part of the Rainier
Mesa Member. A total volume of about 1,200 km3 (300 mi3)
of tuff had been extruded by this time, and a large volcano-
tectonic depression formed, including the Timber
Mountain caldera and probably the adjacent Oasis Valley
caldera segment. There is little evidence to indicate
whether or not there was central resurgent doming of the
Rainier Mesa Member within this depression, except for
the westward-tilted block in the Transvaal Hills west of
Timber Mountain caldera.

  During the brief interval between the eruptions of the
Rainier Mesa Member and Ammonia Tanks Members of
the Timber Mountain Tuff (11.3-11.1 m.y.), pre-
Ammonia Tanks rhyolite lavas were extruded within the
caldera that had resulted from the Rainier Mesa eruptions
(diagram 7, fig. 26).

  The Ammonia Tanks Member of the Timber Mountain
Tuff was erupted 11.1 m.y. ago. Nearly half its total
volume of 900 km3 (230 mi3) probably accumulated within
a concomitantly subsiding caldera, as evidenced by the fact
that no debris flows or breccias are known to intertongue
with the tuff. This episode of cauldron subsidence of
Timber Mountain caldera occurred within an area some-
what smaller than the Rainier Mesa collapse area
(diagram 7, fig. 26) and was centered farther south, with
