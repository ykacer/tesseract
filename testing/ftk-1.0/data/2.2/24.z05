  Frequently the reaction of nitrogen dioxide in the liquid phase with a metal results
in the formation of an adherent film which slows down any subsequent reaction.
This is apparently not so with zinc and hence the reaction with this element has been
thoroughly examined. The alkali metals react rapidly and controllably with liquid
dinitrogen tetroxide to yield the corresponding nitrates but no nitrite.46 Zinc reacts
readily with nitrogen dioxide to give a white crystalline solid, insoluble in nitrogen
dioxide, and having the formula Zn(NO3)2,2N~O4.113 At 100~ the pure anhydrous
nitrate is formed. The kinetics of this reaction have been examined114 as has the
effect of the addition of dinitrogen trioxide or nitrosyl chloride. In the former case
no additional compounds are formed, although the rate of reaction is increased.115
With nitrosyl chloride, depending on the conditions of reaction, it is possible to
obtain the chloride or the nitrate, sometimes solvated.116
  Solutions of diethylnitrosamine in dinitrogen tetroxide behave in a mann~~ that
may be interpreted in terms of the following equilibria117:
