mainly used to induce abortion in women in the ear-
liest weeks of pregnancy, although it has begun to be
used as a morning-after contraceptive in Britain.
  This new study, sponsored by the World Health
Organization with the approval of the US Food and
Drug Administration, jumps ahead of a long-awaited
US trial of RU-486 as an abortion pill.
  The drug is already being studied elsewhere in
the United States for other uses, including as a
treatment for fibroid tumors and endometriosis, and
as an alternative to chemotherapy for women with
breast cancer.
  Although Roussel-Uclaf, the French manufactur-
er of RU-486, has agreed to US tests of the pill for
abortion use, negotiations have dragged on for more
than a year with the Population Council, a New
York-based research group Roussel has chosen as
its licensee.
  That delay comes on top of a history of reluc-
tance by Roussel to tangle with the Reagan and
Bush administrations' antiabortion stance and with
right-to-life groups, which have threatened to boy-
cott products of Hoechst Celanese Corp., the US
subsidiary of Roussel-Uclaf's parent company,
Hoeschst AG of Germany.
  The San Francisco study, in which RU-486 will
be supplied by Roussel, probably would not have
been possible without the Clinton administration's
decision last year to encourage research into RU-486
that could lead to FDA approval.
  Overlooked in the controversy over RU-486,
Grimes said, is the fact that so-called postcoital con-
traception is already available to American women.
  Two tablets of a birth control pill called Ovral
taken within 72 hours of having sex and two more
pills 12 hours later have been proven effective in
preventing pregnancy, Grimes said. But women who
follow this morning-after pill regimen experience un-
pleasant side effects, including vomiting, which is
why interest has focused on RU-486, he said.
  The San Francisco study is part of a larger inter-
national effort to determine the minimum effective
dosage of RU-486 as an emergency contraceptive.
Although studies in Britain have shown that 600 mil-
ligrams of RU-486 in three pills can prevent preg-
nancy, researchers suspect a lower dosage, with few
side effects, can also be effective.
  If the drug fails and the women become preg-
nant, they will be offered abortions at no cost.
  Potentially, the drug could gain approval by the
Food and Drug Administration as an emergency
contraceptive before it is approved as an abortion
pill. Once a drug is approved, it may be used by doc-
