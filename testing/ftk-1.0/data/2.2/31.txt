over a distance b. Thus the work required to move the
dislocation line is




The work involved is identified with the product of the
force FS on the dislocation line and the distance the line
has moved~ or the force per unit length on the edge
dislocation due to the ~hear ~tress is




The choice of ~ign ~or direction) of the force depends on
whether the e~tra ~heet of atoms forming the dislocation is
inserted from above or below the slip plane in Fig. 8.10a.
  Figure ~.10b shows the force exerted on an edge
dislocation due to an applied tensile stress that acts in a
plane parallel to the slip plane and normal to the
dislocation line. By arguments similar to that used above
for applied ~hear stresses, the resulting force on the
dislocation is found to be ~~~~ and in a direction
perpendicular to the slip plane. The sign depends on
whether the extra sheet of atoms is above or below the slip
plane in Fig. 8.10b. The sign also depends on the type of
normal stress. If the normal stress is tensile, the force is
directed away from the extra sheet of atoms forming the
edge dislocation (this case is shown in Fig. 8.10b~. A
compressive stress tends to drive the dislocation line in the
opposite direction.
  In a stress field consisting of both normal and shear
components, the vector force on a unit length edge
dislocation is given by




where i and j are unit vectors in the x- and y-directions,
respectively, and the sign depends on the orientation of the
extra atomic plane forming the dislocation.
  Edge dislocations move easily only in their slip (or
glide) plane. Motion perpendicular to the slip plane by
climb requires transport of vacancies or interstitials to or
from the bulk of the solid to the dislocation line by
diffusion. Point defect migration under most conditions is
slow because the concentrations of vacancies or interstitials
is quite low. However, at temperatures above roughly
one-half the melting point (~K) or in a radiation field,
sufficient point defects are present and their mobility is
great enough to permit edge dislocation climb to take place
at measurable rates. The climb process is of primary
importance in the slow plastic deformation mechanism
known as creep, which profoundly affects the performance
of reactor fuel elements.
  The force causing climb is not restricted to external
stresses applied to the solid, as shown in Fig. 8.10b. The
internal stress due to the presence of other nearby
dislocations or to the creation of high point defect
supersaturation by radiation can also induce climb of the
edge portions of dislocations (Chap. 16, Sec. 16.7).
  A similar analysis can be applied to a screw dislocation.
Figure 8.11 shows a screw dislocation of length S which
experiences a force per unit length F in the slip direction
due to an applied shear stress ~yz. The subscripts on the
shear stress indicate that it acts in the slip plane (which is
perpendicular to the y-axis) and in the direction of the





z-axis. Note that in this case the force on the dislocation
line is at right angles to the direction of the applied stress
that produces the force. If the screw dislocation moves a
distance ~x in the x direction, an area S ~x slips by
a distance b in the slip direction (the z-direction). The work
done by the applied stress is (~~~S ~x)b. Equating this
quantity of work to a force on the dislocation line acting in
the x-direction times the distance the line moves, we find
the force on a unit length of screw dislocation produced by
the shear stress to be




As in the case of stresses acting on edge dislocations, choice
of ~ or - in Eq. 8.14 depends on the sign of the dislocation
(i.e., whether the screw is left-handed or right-handed).
  The dependence of the direction of the force exerted
by a shear stress on the sign of both edge and screw
dislocations implies that the dislocation loop shown in
Fig. 8.6 can be made to expand uniformly in the radial
direction by a shear force in the direction of the arrow in
the drawing. The x-direction force exerted on the edge
component at A is ~~xyb, and the edge component at C is
subject to a force -~xyb. Similarly, the y-direction forces
on the screw components at B and D are ~~xyb and -~~xyb,
respectively.
  Tensile or compressive stresses produce no force on a
screw dislocation, which is incapable of movement by
climb.

8.5 MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES OF
    DISLOCATIONS

8.5.1 Density of Dislocation Lines

  The concentration of dislocation lines in a solid is
measured by the number of dislocation lines that penetrate
a unit area within the crystal. This quantity, which is
known as the dislocation density, ranges from ~104
dislocations cm2 in high-purity carefully prepared semicon-
ductor single crystals (germanium or silicon) to ~1011
