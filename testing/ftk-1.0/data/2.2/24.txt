Nitrogen Dioxide and Dinitrogen Tetroxide	263




is reversible at approximately 400~. It appears that certain nitrites are not affected
by liquid dinitrogen tetroxide,47 and that the oxidation to nitrate which occurs at
high temperature is in fact due to atomic oxygen produced by collision of the nitrogen
dioxide molecules with the surface of the nitrite, yielding nitric oxide at the same
time. Any nitrite which decomposes may appear to react, owing to the reaction of
the products of the decomposition.102
  The induced decomposition of hyponitrites has been reported to take place at 0~
in the presence of nitrogen dioxide.102 The reactions that occur are those found in
the thermal decomposition of hyponitrites:




These results appear to be quite different from those of Addison, Gamlen and
Thompson103 who find that unlike nitrite and nitrate, hyponitrite and oxyhypo-
nitrite (Na2N2O~) are immediately oxidized by liquid nitrogen dioxide.
  The explosive decomposition of triethylammonium nitrate and nitrogen dioxide
mixtures has been mentioned104 and the reaction of sodamide with nitrogen dioxide
in carbon tetrachloride solution has been shown to result in the production of the
amidonitrate.105

		The Action of Nitrogen Dioxide on Metals

  Nitrogen dioxide readily attacks many metals and several papers describing such
reactions are of a technical nature. Earlier work indicated that nitrogen dioxide
attacks iron and copper,106, 107 and it was later suggested108 that in the case of
copper the product is the oxide, Cu2O. With mercury the products of reaction were
thought to be mercurous nitrite and mercuric nitrite.154 Recently109 the reaction has
been shown to be represented by the equation:




The reaction of selenium with gaseous nitrogen dioxide produces selenium dioxide.110
The interaction of nitrogen dioxide with atomic sodium results in a powerful chemi-
luminescence111 which has been attributed to the following scheme112:




  Frequently the reaction of nitrogen dioxide in the liquid phase with a metal results
in the formation of an adherent film which slows down any subsequent reaction.
This is apparently not so with zinc and hence the reaction with this element has been
thoroughly examined. The alkali metals react rapidly and controllably with liquid
dinitrogen tetroxide to yield the corresponding nitrates but no nitrite.46 Zinc reacts
readily with nitrogen dioxide to give a white crystalline solid, insoluble in nitrogen
dioxide, and having the formula Zn(NO3)2,2N~O4.113 At 100~ the pure anhydrous
nitrate is formed. The kinetics of this reaction have been examined114 as has the
effect of the addition of dinitrogen trioxide or nitrosyl chloride. In the former case
no additional compounds are formed, although the rate of reaction is increased.115
With nitrosyl chloride, depending on the conditions of reaction, it is possible to
obtain the chloride or the nitrate, sometimes solvated.116
  Solutions of diethylnitrosamine in dinitrogen tetroxide behave in a mann~~ that
may be interpreted in terms of the following equilibria117:




Zinc reacts with these solutions to yield a r~d liquid, immiscible with nitrogen
dioxide,118 which is the same as the solution obtained by dissolving Zn(NO3)22N2O4
