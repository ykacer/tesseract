joints of like properties lie on a plane of near
isotropy, even for small samples. The unique
major axis contains the central plane of each
set, in other words, lies parallel to the predomi-
nant direction of intersections. Permeability in
the isotropic plane is half the value in the direc-
tion of the intersection.
  When the two orthogonal sets differ, as in
Plate 3, Figure 4, three unique axes appear, one
parallel to the central normal of each set. The
