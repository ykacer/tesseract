America began its 2800-mile, 89-hour
round trip at the Race Rock Cafe, a snazzy
automotive-themed eatery in the Detroit
suburb of Fraser.
  The Race Rock, run by ex-elephant
trainer Bobby Moore, has a Newman-Haas
Indy car suspended from the ceiling, which
revolves over the bar. Upside-down. This
is good to know in advance, otherwise you
are likely to glance up, take one look at
your drink, and place an emergency call to
Betty Ford.
  Regular readers know that One Lap
began in 1984 as a generally law-abiding,
8500-mile, week-long endurance rally run
round the country, from Detroit to Detroit
usually by way of California, Texas, and
Florida. One Lap is a kinder, gentler evo-
lution of Yates's not-even-remotely-legal
Cannonball Run, which was a mad dash
from New York to Los Angeles. Yates dis-
continued the Cannonball Run in 1979,
aware that it was just a matter of time
before a competitor T-boned a bus from the
Our Lady of Perpetual Motion Rest Home,
likely resulting in unfavorable publicity.
