logically and petrographically from members of the Paint-
brush Tuff, as now defined, and is more closely related in
its petrography to the intracaldera tuffs and rhyolites of
Area 20. The xenolithic inclusions of intracaldera Grouse
Canyon and the areal distribution of the Stockade Wash
indicate a source within the Silent Canyon caldera. The
total erupted volume of the Stockade Wash was about
20-40 km3 (5-10 mi3). Recurrent minor subsidences
probably occurred within Silent Canyon caldera as the
thick sequence of tuffs and rhyolites of Area 20
accumulated inside the caldera, with the result that the
underlying Crater Flat Tuff was eventually downdropped
more than 2 km (diagram 2, fig. 26).

  The members of the Paintbrush Tuff and petro-
logically related alkali-calcic lavas were erupted from the
Claim Canyon cauldron (diagram 3, fig. 26) resulting in a
caldera of unknown extent. Only a small segment of the
Claim Canyon cauldron is now exposed, but the general
size and location of the collapse structure can be inferred,
from distribution of tuffs and lavas north and south of
Timber Mountain caldera, to be about 25 km (15 mi) in
diameter and to be centered several kilometres west of the
present summit of Timber Mountain. The oldest member
of the Paintbrush Tuff, the Topopah Spring, was erupted
about 13 m.y. ago with a total volume of about 250 km3 (60
mi3). Recurrent subsidence within the cauldron followed
eruption of the Topopah Spring Member of the Paint-
brush Tuff, and probably a minor collapse followed the
eruption of the Pah Canyon and Yucca Mountain
Members. Within the caldera they accumulated to several
times their thickness outside the caldera. The Tiva
Canyon Member, representing the climactic eruption in
the evolution of the Claim Canyon cauldron, flowed out
about 12.5 m.y. ago mainly to the west of the Claim
Canyon cauldron. The tuff of Chocolate Mountain, which
is about 1,000 m (3,300 ft) thick, was erupted as a late
quartz latitic phase of the Tiva Canyon and was confined
within the Claim Canyon cauldron, suggesting that
collapse was occurring during its eruption, although
Christiansen and others (1976) infer a collapse to the west
of the site of Oasis Valley. Tuff breccia, similar petro-
graphically to the Tiva Canyon, was generated at vents
along or near the wall of the Claim Canyon cauldron
segment. The volume of the Tiva Canyon, including the
intracauldron tuff of Chocolate Mountain, may have
totaled as much as 1,000 km3 (250 mi3). The youngest
separate cooling unit of the Paintbrush, the tuff of Pinyon
Pass, followed very soon after the Tiva Canyon was
confined to the newly formed caldera.

  After eruption of the ash-flow sheets of the Paintbrush
Tuff and after the formation of the caldera, intricate
faulting occurred within the Paintbrush cauldron, similar
to that on Timber Mountain. The fault pattern is inter-
preted by the present authors (see also Christiansen and
