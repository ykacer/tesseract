  Nevada oil shale was first recognized at Elko in 1875 by R. M. Catlin
(Russell, 1980, p. 75), and there were some attempts at about that same time
(before the character of oil shales was recognized) to utilize some of the
darker shales as coal for the railroad (Winchester, 1923, p. 101). The Elko
oil shales were described in the early geological reports on the area by the
U.S. Geological Survey. Although he did not refer to the rocks as oil shale,
Clarence King (1878, p. 312) described brown carbonaceous beds north of Elko as
"containing a high proportion of volatile hydrocarbons burning when heated with
an intensely blue flame ... ."
  The term oil shale was first used in the Nevada geologic literature by
Schrader and others (1916), who reported oil shale outcrops near Elko and at
Hamilton west of Ely. Lincoln (1923) briefly mentioned five other Nevada
localities. Several of these localities have had no further geologic investi-
gation to date (for example, the locations queried on fig. 1).
  The Catlin Shale Products Company plant at Elko, operated intermittently
between 1917 and 1924, was the best technically oriented and best financed
effort to develop western U.S. oil shales during this period (Russell, 1980,
p. 75). Although over 12,000 barrels of shale oil were probably produced,
the plant was a commercial failure and the shale oil products were generally of
poor quality. The Catlin operation was a pioneer effort in the U.S. to develop
methods to produce shale oil for competition with petroleum products (Russell,
1980, p. 75).
  Except for the Elko shales, no other attempts have been made to exploit
any of the State's scattered oil shales. Although several oil shale localities
in Nevada have been known for some time, only recently have investigators begun
