  Dennis Knobloch's eyes probe every detail as
he guides his black Chevrolet pickup through
the ruined village of Valmeyer in a daily ritual
that he can neither fully explain nor avoid.
  "I just have to come down here every day,"
he says solemnly, following Illinois Route 156
down the steep bluffs and into a ghost town that
was his to run, his to save and now is his to
rebuild.
