dispersed joints have been modeled [Snow,
1965], a few examples of which are shown here
in stereograhic projections. Systems of any
desired complexity can be generated by com-
bining individual dispersions differing in direc-
tion of central tendency, dispersion coefficient,
or spacing. Plate 1 shows the change of aniso-
tropy for a single set having a given dispersion
as the sample size changes. Plate 2 shows the
effect of decreasing orientation dispersion from
Fisher's K~ = 6 to 60. Plate 3 treats two ortho-
gonal sets, Plate 4 two nonorthogonal sets, and
Plate 5 three orthogonal sets.
  In any one model, spacing has been main-
tained by proportioning the sample size of each
set according to equation 26 and Figure 5.
  Also displayed in stereographic projection are
the principal permeability axes for 49 sampl-
ings, disclosing the range of possible solutions.
Orthogonal triplets of diamonds, circles, and
crosses correspond to maximum, intermediate,
and minimum permeability axes. The scatter
simulates the variation in principal permeability
axes that must exist from one place to another
in jointed rock. The axes close on mean direc-
tions as the sample size or volume increases.
Dispersion of the axes would be concealed by
mean values, using only large samples. Note
that aberrant axial orientations are possible
from a random model, as illustrated in Plate 1,
Figure 3, by the minor axis (cross) oriented
N 78~W, 30~ from the vertical. If a sample
contains one large opening it will dominate the
directional permeability just as an open fault
will dominate the flow in a region.
  Distribution curves of principal permeabili-
ties are plotted. Diamonds, circles, and crosses
maintain correspondence of principal axes and
permeabilities. Since the maximum, interme-
diate, and minimum permeabilities were ranked
separately for cumulatve plotting, the three
values found at any one ordinate do not con-
stitute a particular solution. To preserve in-
dividual relationships, on the right of the
permeability plots the cumulative distribution
of maximum anisotropies has been plotted, each
being the ratio of minimum permeability to
maximum permeability for a particular solu-
tion.
  The dispersion of principal permeabilities is
portrayed in Plate 1. The large dispersions com-
puted are consistent with the large observed




variations in measured permeabilities in jointed
rocks, reflecting dependence upon the cube of
variable aperture. The dispersions of principal
axes (Plate 1, Figures 3 and 5) and perme-
abilities (Plate 1, Figures 4 and 6) decrease
for samples of increasing size (100 and 500
joints, respectively), as anticipated from the
central limit theorem. Principal axes are con-
centrated within about 10~ and 5~ of are for
the 100 and 500 conduit samples, respec-
tively. Median permeability values increase
slightly with sample size as shown in the sum-
mary plot (Figure 2). Studies have indicated
that model permeability is well-defined for 100
or more joints; otherwise it is a function of size.
  The stereographic projections of principal
axes display three of the quantities required to
define a second rank tensor, and the cumulative
permeability plots display the other three. Thus
each pair of plots should be read together. Cer-
tain mutual relationships are evident. If two
principal permeabilities are nearly the same
each time a sample is taken, then their axial
orientations are sensitive to differences in the
conductors in the samples. Since any two equal
orthogonal permeability vectors define a plane
of isotropy, we find that successive solutions for
a single set of dispersed joint orientations scatter
orientations throughout a great circle of the
stereonet, such as the equatorial planes of Fig-
ures 3 and 5 of Plate 1. The normal to the plane
of isotropy is the only unique principal axis, as
is the optic axis of a uniaxial mineral. Figures
4 and 6 of Plate 1 show slight differences be-
tween principal permeabilities on the isotropic
plane (maximum and intermediate permeabili-
ties), whereas the intermingling of diamonds
and circles on the girdle in the stereogram indi-
cates statistical isotropy, especially for large
samples.
  Sheeted granite is a prototype of a single
set of joints. Plate 2 illustrates the effect of de-
creasing orientation dispersion of a single set of
joints. The joint populations for Fisher's K~ =
6 to 60 are shown, as well as the principal axes
and permeabilities for samples of size 92 to 106,
varying according to equation 26 to maintain a
sample volume of 1035 cm cubed for a jointed
medium of inverse specific surface 10 cm. As
orientation dispersion decreases, there is pro-
gressive reduction of the dispersion of axes and
permeabilities, diminution of the minor perme-

highest permeabilities, and a marked increase
of anisotropy. Figures 5 and 6 of Plate 2 illus-

  It is rarer to find only two sets of joints in
rock than to find one or three sets. Two ortho-
gonal joint sets of equal properties are repre-
sented in Plate 3, Figure 1. Principal axes shown
in Plate 3, Figure 2, indicate that the central
tendencies of normals to two sets of orthogonal




joints of like properties lie on a plane of near
isotropy, even for small samples. The unique
major axis contains the central plane of each
set, in other words, lies parallel to the predomi-
nant direction of intersections. Permeability in
the isotropic plane is half the value in the direc-
tion of the intersection.
  When the two orthogonal sets differ, as in
Plate 3, Figure 4, three unique axes appear, one
parallel to the central normal of each set. The
