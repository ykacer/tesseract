ing asperities from the surrounding blocks. The
relevant value of JRC can be obtained from:




where
  T1 = 	tangential component of the self-weight of the
	overlying block (for inclined joint planes)
  T2 =	external pulling force (or pushing force if
	applied via a flat jack inserted between the
	line-drilled walls of two adjacent blocks =
	`push' test)
  N  =	normal component of block weight (W)
  A  =  joint area

  Equation (2) can then be used to predict the complete
peak shear strength envelope over the desired level of
normal stress.
  It is important to note that in estimating JRC from
equations (3) or (5) the input values for JCS and ~r
need not be very accurate. Since the ratio of JCS/~n
would probably be in the range of 1000-100,000 in
most conceivable cases, the error in the estimate of ~r
would be reduced by a factor of 3-5. Also, the error in
estimating the full-scale value of JCS would be rela-
tively small due to the logarithmic formulation. In each
case, equations (3) or (5) ensure an automatic compen-
sation for overestimates or underestimates of ~r and/or
JCS by producing underestimated or overestimated
values for JRC, since the three components combined
(JRC, JCS, ~r) have to constitute the measured
strength. The errors in the values of peak arctan (~/~n)~
predicted at the required engineering levels of normal
stress (~n) would be relatively small (e.g. [12]).

Correction of JRC values measured on laboratory
samples
  It may not always be possible to conduct large-scale
(natural block size) tilt, push or pull tests. A method is
needed to extrapolate laboratory JRC values to longer

of about 2% of the joint length corresponds to the critical asperities controlling JRC and peak shear strength.
