if the two flanks of a basin are of low relief, ~
that there are no local systems, the bulk of t~
basin discharge will take place between the mi~
line and the valley bottom and only a small po~
tion will appear as baseflow.
  9. A further consequence of the theory 
that the water levels at shallow depths are t~
most affected by seasonal recharge and d~
charge. The small intake and outlet areas of t~
intermediate and regional zones prevent t~
water levels from fluctuating widely. Plotnik~
and Bogomolov [1958, p. 90] make a distin~
tion between two zones on the basis of fluctu~
tion of the water levels. They call the first `zo~
of oscillations of underground water levels.' A~
cording to them the volume of water that occ~
pies the zone of oscillation undergoes season
variations. This volume would control groun~
water discharge and therefore they call it `co~
trol reserves of underground waters.' Their se~
ond zone includes all the water that is below th
zone of oscillation, both that in the deeper, st~
homogeneous parts of the basin and that i
artesian aquifers; these are the `secular r~
sources.' It seems that the `zone of oscillatio~
and the portion of the `secular resources' th~
