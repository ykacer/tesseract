z-axis. Note that in this case the force on the dislocation
line is at right angles to the direction of the applied stress
that produces the force. If the screw dislocation moves a
distance ~x in the x direction, an area S ~x slips by
a distance b in the slip direction (the z-direction). The work
done by the applied stress is (~~~S ~x)b. Equating this
quantity of work to a force on the dislocation line acting in
the x-direction times the distance the line moves, we find
the force on a unit length of screw dislocation produced by
the shear stress to be
