where i and j are unit vectors in the x- and y-directions,
respectively, and the sign depends on the orientation of the
extra atomic plane forming the dislocation.
  Edge dislocations move easily only in their slip (or
glide) plane. Motion perpendicular to the slip plane by
climb requires transport of vacancies or interstitials to or
from the bulk of the solid to the dislocation line by
diffusion. Point defect migration under most conditions is
slow because the concentrations of vacancies or interstitials
is quite low. However, at temperatures above roughly
one-half the melting point (~K) or in a radiation field,
sufficient point defects are present and their mobility is
great enough to permit edge dislocation climb to take place
at measurable rates. The climb process is of primary
importance in the slow plastic deformation mechanism
known as creep, which profoundly affects the performance
of reactor fuel elements.
  The force causing climb is not restricted to external
stresses applied to the solid, as shown in Fig. 8.10b. The
internal stress due to the presence of other nearby
dislocations or to the creation of high point defect
supersaturation by radiation can also induce climb of the
edge portions of dislocations (Chap. 16, Sec. 16.7).
  A similar analysis can be applied to a screw dislocation.
Figure 8.11 shows a screw dislocation of length S which
experiences a force per unit length F in the slip direction
due to an applied shear stress ~yz. The subscripts on the
shear stress indicate that it acts in the slip plane (which is
perpendicular to the y-axis) and in the direction of the
