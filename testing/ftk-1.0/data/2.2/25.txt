solution method (see Ref. 14). The result is




where tDA represents the dimensionless time based
on the drainage area:




The pressure drop on the fracture for a vertical
fracture at the center of a square (xe = ye and xu =
~u) is then given by




The pressure drops on the fracture for a uniform
flux fracture and for an infinite-conductivity fracture
are obtained by evaluating Eq. 29 at xD = 0 and
~D = 0.732, respectively. The choice of the same
point as in the infinite case leads to reasonable
results and can be justified a posteriori by the
method of desuperposition, presented later in this
paper. Numerical values of the dimensionless
