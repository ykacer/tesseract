With AT&T, you can count on crisp, clear connections -- day or

you waiting, either.  Your calls go through quickly virtually
every time you try -- even during the busiest times.

And AT&T has thousands of helpful long distance operators ready
to assist you with person-to-person, collect and international

misdialed numbers.

       We'll even watch out for you when you're away.

When you use the AT&T Calling Card to make your calls over the
AT&T Network, you can depend on our quality and reliability when
you're calling long distance away from home.  You can use it to
reach the AT&T Network from almost any public or private phone.

        We help you control your long distance costs.

In addition, if you like to keep in touch, AT&T savings options
offer you the opportunity to make your long distance dollars go
even further.  We'll help you choose an individualized plan that
fits the way you call.

For example, with the AT&T AnyHourSM savings option, you can call anyone,
anytime and enjoy great prices on direct-dialed calls to anywhere in
the continental U.S. , Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin
Islands.  It's a simple way to save off basic AT&T Long Distance prices.
