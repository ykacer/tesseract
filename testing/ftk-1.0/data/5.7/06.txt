READER'S DIGEST




she is nearly 90, "I've never been
prejudiced in my life-~and you
know it."
  We see the change in her attitude
begin with an ice storm that dis-
rupts power in Atlanta. After mak-
ing his way to her house over slick
roads, Hoke tells Daisy, "I figured
your stove was out. I know you gots
to have your coffee in the morn-
ing." At the end of the film, she
takes his hand and confesses,
"You're my best friend. You are,
you are."
  Driving Miss Daisy is now on
Variety's list of all-time box-office
champs. Jessica Tandy won the Os-
car for Best Actress. Dan Aykroyd,
who played Daisy's son, and Mor-
gan Freeman were also nominated
for Oscars.
  "When I was a kid, I wanted to
be a movie star," Freeman says.
"Somewhere along the way, I
started to think, `No. Stardom is
nothing. I want to change people's
attitudes. I want to make movies
that mend us. I want to be a force
for healing.'
  "I have a large stake in the future
that movies like Driving Miss Daisy
are helping to bring about. I tell my
children and grandchildren it's will-
power that does things. All it takes is
one individual to say, `This will
stop'-~or to start something good."
  Freeman and Avildsen are now
making a movie on precisely that




theme, about a white boy and
apartheid in South Africa, titled
The Power of One.

"GREAT MOVIES are movies with
great characters," says Avildsen.
"Characters who stand for some-
thing bigger than themselves. That
something is good values."
  Indeed, all four of these critically
acclaimed, financially successful
and widely honored films are about
universal values that reflect the ba-
sic good in people: hard work, self-
respect, love of family, friends,
community and God. In an age
when so many films show mindless
violence and sex without intimacy,
the public embraces these movies
that sell neither. "Such films show
us," says director Mark Rydell,
"how the individual can make a
difference-~in his own life and the
lives of others."
  And they give us hope. "You
can't sell hopelessness to people,"
says Morgan Freeman. "They
won't buy it. They can get that for
free."
  At a memorial service for Frank
Capra last October, Avildsen offered
one further idea about why great
movies get made. "One of their
messages," he said, "is that ordi-
nary individuals are capable of ex-
traordinary acts. We keep coming
back to hear that message, back to
drink at the well with good water."

      ARE WE SPENDING
        ENOUGH ON
     AMERICA'S SCHOOLS?

GOVERNMENT EDUCATION SPENDING per student, among the highest in
the more developed countries, has climbed 33 percent in the past
decade. "I don't think there's a person anywhere who would say
we've seen a 33-percent improvement in our schools' performance,"
President Bush says in America 2000: An Education Strategy. In fact,
most student-achievement scores show little or no improvement,
and our teen-agers rank low on international math and science
comparisons. "Let's stop trying to measure progress in terms of
money spent," the President concludes. "It's time we held our
schools-~and ourselves-~accountable for results."
