Begin with a clean grill rack.  To make clean up easier, spray the rack with vegetable
cooking spray before placing it over the lit coals.
Use tongs or a spatula to turn meat because when you puncture it with a fork, the
meat loses its juiciness.
Place fish on the grill rack perpendicular to the grill bars to minimize sticking.
Don't allow the coals to blaze or the food will get a hard, crusty texture.
