THE LOST FLEET OF GUADALCANAL
(1993, Columbia TriStar, $19.95)
When Robert Ballard, who discov-
ered the Titanic and the Bismarck,
set off in 1992 to find 50 "ghost
ships" downed in the World War II
battle of Guadalcanal, he met with
only modest success.  Fortunate-
ly, he'd brought reinforcements:
American and Japanese survivors
of the harrowing six-month fight.
Their moving reminiscences 50
years later, accompanied by vivid
archival footage, far eclipse Bal-
lard's underwater video of sunken
metal.  Combining elements of the
Jacques Cousteau and war-docu-
mentary genres, National Geo-
graphic's Lost Fleet ultimately tran-
scends both.  A  -~Susan Chumsky

PRIDE AND JOY:  THE STORY OF ALLIGA-
TOR RECORDS Koko Taylor, Lonnie
Brooks (1993, BMG, $29.95)  For
more than two decades, Alligator
Records has been introducing
young, mostly white music fans to
contemporary hard blues.  The la-
bel's success story-~captured in
this 87-minute documentary-~in-
volves equal parts nostalgia, clever
marketing, and a genuine labor of
love.  Director Robert Mugge (Deep
Blues) places Alligator in the con-
text of the Chicago blues scene, in-
terviews key players, and presents
some enthralling live performances.
But the tape still suffers from the
perfunctory:  In band interviews,
Alligator artists reveal a good-na-
tured sincerity without ever dig-
ging deeper than Taylor's remark,
"We ate it.  We slept it.  We was born
with the blues."  C+  -~Taehee Kim
