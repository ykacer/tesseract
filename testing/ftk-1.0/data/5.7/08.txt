sauces and marinades, or rub them directly on the meat.  Text by Betsy Fannin

Grill It With Herbs




A backyard cookout is one of the
rites of summer.  And now that
herbs are at their best, it's a
great time to savor their fresh
flavor in foods cooked on the grill.
     Herbs can be grown both indoors or




outdoors, in pots or in gardens.  But if you
don't have an herb garden, you can usu-
ally find fresh herbs in your supermarket's
produce section.  Substitute dried herbs for
fresh ones by using one teaspoon dried,
crushed herb for each tablespoon of fresh.




HOT TIPS FOR GREAT GRILLING




Begin with a clean grill rack.  To make clean up easier, spray the rack with vegetable
cooking spray before placing it over the lit coals.
Use tongs or a spatula to turn meat because when you puncture it with a fork, the
meat loses its juiciness.
Place fish on the grill rack perpendicular to the grill bars to minimize sticking.
Don't allow the coals to blaze or the food will get a hard, crusty texture.
