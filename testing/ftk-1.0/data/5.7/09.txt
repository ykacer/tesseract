  SAN JOSE, Calif. -~ Jimmy Delgado
got his gang tattoos to tell the world
who he was. He wants to get rid of
them because of who he wants to be.
  The distinctive marks turn off pro-
spective employers, threatening the
life he plans away from the street.
  "I stopped trying to look for a job,"
Delgado said. "Even if I'm dressed
nice ... they don't want to hear what
I have to say."
  The 17-year-old former member of
the Palmas gang doesn't plan on hav-
ing the palm-tree tattoo on his neck
much longer.
  He is among about 100 youths ex-
pected to take advantage of a new city
program under which a plastic sur-
geon will remove gang tattoos for free.
  "A gang tattoo not only says some-
thing about your past, it can rob you
of your dreams for tomorrow and
can damage a young person's self-
image," Mayor Susan Hammer said
recently in announcing the program.
  Removing tattoos by surgery or by
laser can cost several thousand dol-
lars. But Dr. Josh Korman, who has
traveled to poor countries to repair
cleft palates and do other reconstruc-
tive surgery, is donating his services.
  "I think this will give people an
opportunity to get back into the
workforce," he said.
  The treatment will be at Forest
Surgery Center, which is waiving
most of its fee. The city is contribut-
ing $15,000 to cover some of the ex-
penses and the rental of a laser.
  John Lawrence, 18, plans to take
advantage of the offer. Lawrence, a
former gang member, is back in
school, working toward his high
school equivalency diploma, and
wants to learn various trades.
  He plans to cover up the tattoos on
his arms. But he wants to remove a
large "Good Times Bad Times" tattoo
on his neck, a group of dots on his
cheek and "Turtle" -~ his old gang
name -~ from above his left eyebrow.
  "When you put on a tattoo, you're
advertising who you are and where
you're from," he said.
  At first, he said, "it's fun. ... You
don't see all the bad parts. I just got
tired, man. You can't be looking be-
hind your back forever."
