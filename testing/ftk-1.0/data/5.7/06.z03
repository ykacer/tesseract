"GREAT MOVIES are movies with
great characters," says Avildsen.
"Characters who stand for some-
thing bigger than themselves. That
something is good values."
  Indeed, all four of these critically
acclaimed, financially successful
and widely honored films are about
universal values that reflect the ba-
sic good in people: hard work, self-
respect, love of family, friends,
community and God. In an age
when so many films show mindless
violence and sex without intimacy,
the public embraces these movies
that sell neither. "Such films show
us," says director Mark Rydell,
"how the individual can make a
difference-~in his own life and the
lives of others."
  And they give us hope. "You
can't sell hopelessness to people,"
says Morgan Freeman. "They
won't buy it. They can get that for
free."
  At a memorial service for Frank
Capra last October, Avildsen offered
one further idea about why great
movies get made. "One of their
messages," he said, "is that ordi-
nary individuals are capable of ex-
traordinary acts. We keep coming
back to hear that message, back to
drink at the well with good water."
