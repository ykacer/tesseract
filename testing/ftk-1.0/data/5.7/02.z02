3 mm thick and about 30 mm long; an occasional one
may be 40 mm long and only 1 mm thick. They are
hollow tubes, and many contain a drop or so of water.
Most of them lean or are bent in the direction of the last
strong wind.
   Another feature of the flood plains is the salt pools
which develop where the water table is shallow enough
to dissolve through the salt crust, giving rise to struc-
tures collapsed into the underlying pool for the most
part of salt-saturated water (fig. 37). They are most
abundant and best developed 5~~~ miles northwest of
Badwater, around the north end of the massive rock salt.
