      ARE WE SPENDING
        ENOUGH ON
     AMERICA'S SCHOOLS?

GOVERNMENT EDUCATION SPENDING per student, among the highest in
the more developed countries, has climbed 33 percent in the past
decade. "I don't think there's a person anywhere who would say
we've seen a 33-percent improvement in our schools' performance,"
President Bush says in America 2000: An Education Strategy. In fact,
most student-achievement scores show little or no improvement,
and our teen-agers rank low on international math and science
comparisons. "Let's stop trying to measure progress in terms of
money spent," the President concludes. "It's time we held our
schools-~and ourselves-~accountable for results."
