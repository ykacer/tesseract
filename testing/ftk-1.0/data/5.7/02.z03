   In general, the content of salts in the brines in Death
Valley increases panward, is greater in ground water
than in surface water, greater in dry years than in wet
years, and greater in standing water than in running
water. The increase in salts panward is due both to
evaporation of water and to re-solution of salts. Semi-
quantitative chemical analyses of the brines are given
in tables 50-52.
   The effect of the several variables on the composition
of the brines is illustrated by a series of graphs (figs.
38-50) representing suites of samples along ground-
water and surface-drainage courses into the pan.
   Differences in major constituents along a 5-mile
stretch of Salt Creek where it enters the pan are illus-
trated on figure 38. This graph illustrates the increase
in total salts panward and the increase in sodium and
potassium relative to calcium and magnesium. Car-
bonates were not determined in these brine samples, but
other analyses (table 34) indicate that along one stretch
of Salt Creek there is about a fifth as much bicarbonate
