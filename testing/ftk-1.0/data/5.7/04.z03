VINTAGE

DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY L.M. Kit Car-
son (1967, Fox Lorber, unrated,
$79.95)  Years before he went Hol-
lywood with The Big Easy and
Great Balls of Fire!, director Jim
McBride scored with this droll put-
on, a fake underground movie that
shoots snarky darts through film-
student pretensions.  David Holz-
man (Carson) is a sincere young
twerp who, seeking Big Truth,
films his life in what was the then-
fashionable grainy B&W v~~rit~~.
What he finds is a swift corrective
to all those who think movies are
more important than reality.  Raw,
ragged, and right, Diary is both an
unerring late-'60s time capsule and
as modern as teen angst.  A-  -~TB
