   Salinity Studies.-~Salinity measurements of the fluid inclusions in Pennine
minerals were made on a freezing stage consisting of a hexagonal aluminum
cell with a circular inner wall, around which were placed six thermomodules 
connected in series. The heat generated on the hot side of the thermomodules
was removed by circulating pre-cooled tap water through copper plates
clamped to the thermomodules. The aluminum cell was fitted with quartz
windows at top and bottom and a thermocouple placed in the cell in close
proximity to the sample, which was supported in the center of the cell. The
entire system was insulated and the cell filled with acetone. It was found that
~pplication of a current of 10 amps to the thermomodules resulted in a tempera-
ture of -18~ C within the cell, and that above -18~ C it was possible to
adjust the temperature in the cell within ~~ 1~ C by varying the current fed
to the thermomodules. Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain tempera-
tures lower than about -18~ C with this freezing stage. The stage was
calibrated by measuring the melting temperature of n-dodecane (M.P.
