-9.6~ C) sealed in glass capillary tubes, and by placing the bulb of a ther-
mometer adjacent to the thermocouple in the cell.
   Fluid inclusions generally exhibit considerable super-cooling before freez-
ing (33), consequently each specimen was pre-cooled in a mixture of dry ice 
and acetone for 30 minutes and then rapidly transferred to the cooling stage
which was at a temperature of -18~ C. By gradually increasing the tem-
perature within the cell, the temperature at which the last ice crystal in an
~~clusion melted could be obtained. These last melting temperatures have 
~~en interpreted in terms of the system NaCl-H2O (Table 3). In some 
~~stances it was found that the ice crystals in inclusions had already melted
at -18~ C. In such cases it has only been possible to place a minimum value 
on the salinity of the inclusion contents.
   Investigation of the Na/K ratios of Fluid Inclusions.-~In order to measure 
the relative amounts of Na and K in Pennine fluid inclusions samples of
quartz, fluorite, sphalerite and barite exceeding 100 grams in weight were
carefully cleaned and then crushed in a clean tungsten-carbide mixer mill for
