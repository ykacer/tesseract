   A series of samples along a 3,000-foot traverse into
the northeast corner of Cottonball Basin, in the Salt
Springs area, is illustrated on figure 39. This graph
illustrates the panward increase in salts, but it also
shows that the ground water is more saline than surfac~
water at the same position in the pan. Later tests in
this same area indicate that the uppermost layer of
the ground water is more saline than deeper layers.
In February 1958, a few days after a rain, the uppermost
ground water, 3-4 inches below the surface, contained
4.3 percent dissolved solids, whereas ground water
bailed from 3~~~ feet contained only 2.5 percent.
   Springs used as a source of domestic water supplies
in the Furnace Creek area are located along faults on
the fans north of Furnace Creek Wash. Four major
sources are Travertine and Nevares Springs, and
springs in the bluffs near Cow Creek. Analyses of the
waters are given in table 35, page B73.
   The springs at Cow Creek probably are fed by
ground water underflow from the Nevares Springs;
the other springs are warm springs, and probably the
high temperatures are due to circulation at no great
depth but through warm rocks. The thermal gradient
in the ground in this highly faulted area probably i~
higher than average, and an increase of only 30~F
over the annual average temperature would heat the
water to the maximum observed (104~F). This could
be accomplished with circulation no deeper than about
1,500 feet (see p. B40).
   The water is believed to be moving into Death
Valley along faults in the Furnace Creek fault zone
and derived ultimately from the Pahrump Valley
(p. B38; see also Hunt and Robinson, 1960). This
water is very different from that on the west side of
Cottonball Basin, which probably moves in along faults
from Mesquite Flat (p. B37; see also Hunt and
Robinson, 1960).
   The total dissolved solids in these spring waters is
low compared to other Death Valley water; but by the
