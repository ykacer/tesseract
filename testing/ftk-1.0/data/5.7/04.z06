`CRYING' TIME
WITH ARTSIER video renters having
run through Howards End (which drops
off the top 10 this week), The Crying
Game finally joins the chart at No. 7 in
its third week in release.  Apparently,
laserdisc buyers were awaiting the Oscar
nominee far more eagerly than tape
renters:  The laser version debuts at a sur-
prising No. 2.
