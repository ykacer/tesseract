It is time once again for Saint Cloud Hospital to replicate its bi-annual
consumer research study. As the incumbent, we surely would like to again
consider you as a candidate to complete the study. I would appreciate you
providing to me at your earliest convenience, a proposal on behalf of your
firm to do a consumer telephone survey. The survey will consist of a
sample size of 600 with roughly the same survey length as we have
previously done and in approximately the same geographical service area.

Assuming your firm is interested, I look forward to receiving your
proposal. Thank you for your consideration.
