		Introduction

  Clay minerals of the smectite group are important
components of many geologic systems. In addition, they
have highly diverse applications in industry, ranging from
pharmaceutical use to purifying agents to backfill in
radioactive (and other) waste disposal sites. Further-
more, they and other diagenetic clays occur as cements
and pore obstructions in sandstones and may modify the
composition and quantity of pore fluids~ the presence of
these clays are important in both petroleum exploration
and in well completion and stimulation. The varied usage
of smectites is a consequence of their properties such as
compaction, plasticity, catalytic activity, swelling, ion
exchange, density and many others. These are deter-
mined by the nature of the interlayer material in smec-
tites. This interlayer material (cations and water held
between the relatively rigid sheets of tetrahedrally-coor-
dinated and octahedrally-coordinated atoms comprising
the 2:1 layer), readily interacts with the environment and
generally determines its properties. The stability of the
interlayer material with respect to temperature and pres-
sure, therefore, is of great importance in many disci-
plines.
  Whereas the effect of temperature on the interlayer
dehydration of smectites has been studied extensively,
the effect of pressure is not well established. Much of the
information available is from drill cuttings and drill cores
