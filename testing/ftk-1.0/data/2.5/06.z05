with respect to shaft sinking be taken
into account as the Department
proceeds.
  The Commission observes that the
incorporation of this language into the
regulation should have no effect on the
repository program.  If the established
working arrangements (including the
Procedural Agreement, 48 FR 51876,
described in the preamble to the
proposed rule) provide the anticipated
information exchange,  NRC would in
fact be able to review and comment in a
timely fashion during DOE's early
planning processes on those issues that
may have a bearing upon DOE's
decision to proceed with, or delay, the
sinking of repository shafts.  Moreover, 
the Commission is aware that DOE itself
has indicated its intention to wait until it
has completed a review of comments
before proceeding to sink shafts.
