University of Tasmania, the writer wishes to
extend his appreciation for the many stim-
ulating discussions concerning the regional
implications of the study. Special thanks is
extended to the many U. S. Geological Survey
personnel at Mercury, Nevada for their helpful
discussions and support in the field. In addition
to John Rodgers, the manuscript was read by
John P. Albers and Mitchell W. Reynolds,
U. S. Geological Survey, and Lauren Wright,
Pennsylvania State University. Their reviews
led to numerous changes in the manuscript.
The U. S. Atomic Energy Commission was kind
enough to grant the writer a clearance to work
in the southern part of the Nevada Test Site.
  Financial support has been provided by the
Pan American Petroleum Foundation Fellow-
ship (1959), Department of Geology, Yale
University, and Sigma Xi (1960), and Na-
tional Science Foundation Grant G. P. 1154

STRATIGRAPHY

  More than 24,000 feet of Precambrian, lower
Paleozoic and Tertiary rocks crop out in the
Specter Range quadrangle. The Precambrian
and lower Paleozoic rocks are typical of the
clastic and carbonate rocks in the eastern part
of the Cordilleran geosyncline, and are more
than 22,000 feet thick. The Precambrian and
Paleozoic rocks have been divided into 16
mappable units (14 formations, two of which
contain two members each). The four oldest
formations, Precambrian to lower Middle
Cambrian, are composed of clastic rocks.
Quartzite, siltstone, and shale are the common
rock types; limestone and dolomite are minor
and occur as thin beds. From lower Middle
Cambrian through the Upper Devonian, the
rocks are mainly limestone and dolomite with
thin units of quartzite and quartz sandstone.
  Tertiary rocks are present mainly in the
northern part of the quadrangle and overlie
the Paleozoic rocks with angular uncon-
formity. They consist of a basal unit of tuf-
faceous sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and
lacustrine limestone, overlain by approximately
2000 feet of welded and nonwelded tuff of
rhyolitic and dacitic composition with inter-
bedded sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.
These rocks are mapped as one group sub-
divided into three informal units.
  Burchfiel (1964) described the formations
and members mapped during this investigation,
and general descriptions of these formations
and members are given in the stratigraphic




column of rocks exposed in the Specter Range
quadrangle, Plate 2.

STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY

General Statement

  Three structural features of regional sig-
nificance are discussed and interpreted in rela-
tion to the structure of the Specter Range
Quadrangle: (1) the Las Vegas Valley Shear
Zone that enters the Specter Range quadrangle
from the southeast, (2) the extension of the
Johnnie thrust, and (3) three sets of high-angle
faults. Because these structures are of regional
importance, the data obtained within the
Specter Range quadrangle will be presented as
a basis for a regional structural interpretation.
  The most characteristic structural features
of the Specter Range quadrangle are the high-
angle faults, many of which are topographically
expressed; folding is relatively unimportant
and local. The high-angle faults are grouped
into three sets on the basis of similar strike:
(1) a northwest set which strikes N 20~-60~
W., averaging N. 40~-45~ W., (2) a north-south
set whose strike ranges from N. 30~ W. to
N. 35~ E., averaging N. 0~-5~ E., and (3) a
northeast set which strikes from N. 35~ E. to
east-west, averaging N. 60~-65~ E. (see Fig. 1).
They are called high-angle faults rather than
normal faults here because the observed
stratigraphic displacements can be explained
by either dip-slip or strike-slip movements.
The high-angle faults are superposed on older
folds and faults which are related to the Late
Mesozoic and Early Tertiary deformation that
affected the eastern part of the Basin and Range
province.
  The bedrock of the Specter Range quadran-
gle can be conveniently divided into six struc-
tural blocks (Fig. 2). Structures and trends are
similar within each block, but differ from those
of adjacent blocks; the relationships between
blocks are not all clear.

Block I

  Block I, in the northeast quarter of the
quadrangle (Fig. 2), consists of a large area
underlain by rocks of the Oak Springs Group
of Tertiary age and three discontinuous areas
of Paleozoic rocks northeast of the Specter
Range and the northeast-trending ridges north
of Camp Desert Rock. Block I is the simplest
structural block and shows the clearest sequence
of faulting.
