Several springs with temperatures to 88~C discharging 130 L/min.	0.34		0.066		28
  Sulfate-water isotope geothermometer indicates temperatures to 282~C.
  Travertine deposits suggest reservoir temperatures may be lower.

No surface discharge; small area altered by gases. Two wells 152	1.88		0.35		146
  and 1313 m deep; maximum reported temperature of 144~C at bottom
  of shallower well.

No surface discharge. A 1.3-km-deep exploration well encountered a	5.7		1.06		450
  maximum temperature of 156~C at 0.4 km.

Three shallow wells to 229 m with maximum reported temperature of	0.38		0.079		33
  132~C. One additional well of unknown depth drilled in 1974.

More than 13 wells ranging in depths from 73 to 2219 m; maximum		2.0		0.37		157
  reported temperature 214~C. Springs became inactive after
  drilling of first wells in the early 1960s. Na-K-Ca geothermometer
  gives 246~C and may indicate a deep source for the water.
  Geothermal fluid with a working temperature of 154~C is used
  commercially to dehydrate vegetables.

No surface manifestations. Three wells, deepest 2.3 km, sited by	7.2		1.78		750
  geophysical techniques; recorded temperatures over 200~C; two
  wells capable of total mass flow of more than 200,000 kg/hr.
  Geothermal fluids are chemically different from nearby Brady area,
  indicating a separate system.

Two deep and one shallow geothermal test wells near Rye Patch KGRA.	0.45		0.110		47

Several springs with temperatures to 77~C. Low flow rates		1.24		0.23		97
  (20 L/min) may have permitted extensive near-surface water-rock
  reactions which in turn may have adverse effects on the Na-K-Ca
  geothermometer.

Several springs with temperatures to 95~C discharging 690 L/min;	0.96		0.182		77
  sinter.

Twelve wells ranging in depth from 72 to 2917 m; maximum temperature	1.18		0.30		127
  211~C at 2917 m; similar temperatures reported in shallower wells.

Springs to 90~C with abundant sulfur.					0.34		0.065		 27
