  The temperature of the dehydration of interlayer water of Na-montmorillonite (SWy-1,
American Clay Mineral Society Source Clay) is determined at pressures to 1 kbar, using
differential thermal analysis (DTA). Two dehydration reactions occur, about 40~ and 100~C
above the boiling curve of water. Above the critical point of water the dehydration
reactions show only a modest increase of temperature with pressure. No significant
differences in temperature were found using different heating rates and different size
fractions, as defined by their hydraulic diameter. The presence of two dehydration
reactions suggests that not all interlayer water is bonded equally; a distinction may be made
between weakly bonded and strongly bonded water. It is concluded that hydrated Na-
montmorillonite is stable under normal pressure and temperature distributions in sedimen-
tary basins; in these basins dehydration must involve more complex chemical interactions
with pore fluids. The large increase in the stability of a hydrated montmorillonite with a
modest increase in pressure may have important bearing in its use in nuclear waste
disposal.
