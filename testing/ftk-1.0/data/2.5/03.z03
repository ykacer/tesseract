University of Tasmania, the writer wishes to
extend his appreciation for the many stim-
ulating discussions concerning the regional
implications of the study. Special thanks is
extended to the many U. S. Geological Survey
personnel at Mercury, Nevada for their helpful
discussions and support in the field. In addition
to John Rodgers, the manuscript was read by
John P. Albers and Mitchell W. Reynolds,
U. S. Geological Survey, and Lauren Wright,
Pennsylvania State University. Their reviews
led to numerous changes in the manuscript.
The U. S. Atomic Energy Commission was kind
enough to grant the writer a clearance to work
in the southern part of the Nevada Test Site.
  Financial support has been provided by the
Pan American Petroleum Foundation Fellow-

University, and Sigma Xi (1960), and Na-

STRATIGRAPHY

  More than 24,000 feet of Precambrian, lower
Paleozoic and Tertiary rocks crop out in the
Specter Range quadrangle. The Precambrian
and lower Paleozoic rocks are typical of the
clastic and carbonate rocks in the eastern part
of the Cordilleran geosyncline, and are more
than 22,000 feet thick. The Precambrian and
Paleozoic rocks have been divided into 16
mappable units (14 formations, two of which
contain two members each). The four oldest
formations, Precambrian to lower Middle
Cambrian, are composed of clastic rocks.
Quartzite, siltstone, and shale are the common
rock types; limestone and dolomite are minor
and occur as thin beds. From lower Middle
Cambrian through the Upper Devonian, the
rocks are mainly limestone and dolomite with
thin units of quartzite and quartz sandstone.
  Tertiary rocks are present mainly in the
northern part of the quadrangle and overlie
the Paleozoic rocks with angular uncon-
formity. They consist of a basal unit of tuf-
faceous sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and
lacustrine limestone, overlain by approximately
2000 feet of welded and nonwelded tuff of
rhyolitic and dacitic composition with inter-
bedded sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.
These rocks are mapped as one group sub-
divided into three informal units.
  Burchfiel (1964) described the formations
and members mapped during this investigation,
and general descriptions of these formations
and members are given in the stratigraphic
