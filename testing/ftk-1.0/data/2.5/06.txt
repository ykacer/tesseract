does not contemplate a formal comment
analysis.)
  To furnish additional assurance to the
~~~t State and affected Indian Tribes
that their views will be considered in 
NRC's preparation of its SCA, a
provision has been added to the final
regulation providing an opportunity,
before publication of the SCA by NRC,
for those parties to present their views
on the DOE SCP and suggestions with
respect to NRC comments thereon.

~. Site Selection Information

  Some commenters opposed the
deletion of information concerning
DOE's site screening and selection
process from the SCP contents.  Some
commenters also commented
unfavorably on a perceived lack of any
NRC review of DOE's site screening and
selection process.  A few commenters
supported the deletion of such 
information from the SCPs.
  The Commission has carefully
reviewed the arguments presented by
the commenters who stated that site
selection information should still be
included in the SCPs.  The Commission
continues to believe that such
information is neither appropriate nor
required in an SCP.
  In regard to the generalized concern
~~~t NRC should be involved in the site
selection process, it is noted that the
NRC has played an important role in
~~~~ process and will continue to do so.
~~~ sites under consideration for
~~~~~~tion have been the subject of
continuous scrutiny by the NRC staff to
identify licensing issues at the earliest
possible stage.  Available data are
examined on a regular basis and site
specific documents such as the
environmental assessments are carefully
reviewed.  There are also activities
specified by the NWPA which afford the
NRC an opportunity to directly influence
the site selection process.  These are
NRC concurrence in DOE's siting
guidelines and review and comments on
the site characterization plans.  NRC
expects that, under the EIS scoping
process pursuant to CEQ rules, DOE will
keep NRC fully and currently informed 
of its plans for implementation.  We also
expect to review and comment on DOE's
scoping documents and activities for
implementing NEPA in the repository
program which are to be developed
~~rsuant to CEQ rules, and to comment
on DOE's EIS.
  Thus, the issue of concern in this 
rulemaking is not whether the
Commission should be involved in the
DOE site screening and selection
process generally.  It is, more
specifically, the scope of the information
~o be included in the DOE submission.




The NWPA, while generally conforming
to the earlier NRC regulation, omitted
the provisions dealing with NRC review
of site selection matters.  The
Commission construes this action as an
indication that the site selection issues
previously dealt with in Part 60 were to
be separated from the site
characterization reports and dealt with,
instead, in the environmental
assessments.  Under the NWPA, the
Commission's role in the review of
DOE's site characterization plans is to
determine whether they are appropriate
in light of the Commission's regulations.
Attention will be directed toward the
adequate of the characterization of a
particular site: and this is different from, 
and not dependent upon, the
considerations that led to the selection
of that site.

c. Shaft Sinking




  Some commenters suggested that the
regulation should be amended to require
that DOE may not proceed to 
characterize sites by sinking shafts until
NRC and State review and comment
upon the SCP are complete.  One
commenter suggested that the regulation
be clarified to specify that completion of
NRC review is not a condition precedent
for shaft sinking.  The Commission
agrees with the commenters who regard
NWPA as requiring that DOE defer the
sinking of shafts at least until such time
as there has been an opportunity for
pertinent comments on shaft sinking to
have been solicited and considered by
DOE.  As stated in the preamble to the
proposed rule, "The Commission
believes that Congress intended that
DOE should provide the plans
sufficiently far in advance so that
comments may be developed and
submitted back to DOE early enough to
be considered when shaft sinking
occurs, and all times thereafter."  The
question, therefore, is not whether the
Commission agrees with the objective of
those commenters to defer shaft sinking
until after comments on the SCP have
been received by DOE.  The issue,
rather, was whether the Commission
should include in its own regulations an
interpretation of the obligations of DOE
under the statute.  The Commission has
concluded that it should do so, in the
interests of fulfilling its own
responsibilities more effectively.  The
Commission has stressed the
importance of evaluating alternatives to
major design features that are important
to waste isolation, see 10 CFR
~0.21(c)(1)(ii)(D), and in the case of the
design and location of the shafts this
can only be done prior to their sinking.  It
is important to the Commission that the
comments which it may provide to DOE




with respect to shaft sinking be taken
into account as the Department
proceeds.
  The Commission observes that the
incorporation of this language into the
regulation should have no effect on the
repository program.  If the established
working arrangements (including the
Procedural Agreement, 48 FR 51876,
described in the preamble to the
proposed rule) provide the anticipated
information exchange,  NRC would in
fact be able to review and comment in a
timely fashion during DOE's early
planning processes on those issues that
may have a bearing upon DOE's
decision to proceed with, or delay, the
sinking of repository shafts.  Moreover, 
the Commission is aware that DOE itself
has indicated its intention to wait until it
has completed a review of comments
before proceeding to sink shafts.

d. Simultaneous Promulgation of
Amendments



 
  Some commenters recommended that
all revisions to Part 60 and Part 51 to
conform them to the NWPA should be
promulgated simultaneously.  In
particular, they recommended that the
revisions concerning NEPA
requirements accompany the revisions
currently being promulgated.  They
believe that this would assure that a
comprehensive and integrated approach
is taken and any confusion regarding
NWPA and NEPA requirements would
be eliminated.  They argue that much of
Part 60 now rests on NEPA authority so 
that failure to include NEPA in the
currently proposed revision casts a
cloud over the Commission's view of its
authority to carry out early site reviews.
  The Commission has not put off
considering its obligations under NEPA
as modified by the NWPA.  In
developing these changes to the
regulation, the Commission has
specifically considered whether any
procedures might be needed at the site 
screening or characterization s~age, so
as to assure that the Commissio~ would
be able to meet its ultimate NEPA
responsibilities.  The Commission
concludes that they are not.
  The Commission's Part 51 regulations
govern the Commission's
responsibilities for conducting
environmental reviews associated with
its licensing and regulatory functions.
Section 121(c) of NWPA, 42 U.S.C.
10141, clearly states that the
requirements and criteria set forth in
Part 60 relate to the Commission's
responsibility under the Atomic Energy
Act and the Energy Reorganization Act
and do not require a NEPA EIS.  The Part
51 changes, on the other hand, will
