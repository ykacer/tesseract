(Whittaker and Dyson, 1980) on the basis of the clay
mineralogy, but it is difficult to separate the effect of
pressure from that of temperature or of the fixation of
potassium (which produces illite or illite/smectite mixed-
layer clays) from drill core studies alone. Nevertheless, it
is generally agreed that in an open system much of the
interlayer water is easily removed by pressure, with the
exception of either the last or last two hydration layers
(Whittaker and Dyson, 1980). For example, van Olphen
(1963) has calculated that in Ca-bentonites a load of
37,000 p.s.i. is required to remove the next to last water
interlayer and 99,000 p.s.i. for the last interlayer. An
experimental study (Khitarov and Pugin, 1966) indicates
that pressure does not significantly increase the stability
of the interlayer water in smectites. This is at variance
with other experimental studies on smectites, which show
that these clays are stable to temperatures of 400 to 500~C
and pressures of 0.5 and 2 kbar (Eberl et al., 1978). Eberl
et al. point out that increased water pressure should
increase dioctahedral smectite stability in hydrotherm~~
systems with a 1:1 ratio of smectite to pure water. These
results suggest that the more modest pressures fro~
overburden are generally insufficient to cause los~~~~
water from the last hydration shells.
