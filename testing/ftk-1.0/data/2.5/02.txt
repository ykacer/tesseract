			Abstract

  The temperature of the dehydration of interlayer water of Na-montmorillonite (SWy-1,
American Clay Mineral Society Source Clay) is determined at pressures to 1 kbar, using
differential thermal analysis (DTA). Two dehydration reactions occur, about 40~ and 100~C
above the boiling curve of water. Above the critical point of water the dehydration
reactions show only a modest increase of temperature with pressure. No significant
differences in temperature were found using different heating rates and different size
fractions, as defined by their hydraulic diameter. The presence of two dehydration
reactions suggests that not all interlayer water is bonded equally; a distinction may be made
between weakly bonded and strongly bonded water. It is concluded that hydrated Na-
montmorillonite is stable under normal pressure and temperature distributions in sedimen-
tary basins; in these basins dehydration must involve more complex chemical interactions
with pore fluids. The large increase in the stability of a hydrated montmorillonite with a
modest increase in pressure may have important bearing in its use in nuclear waste
disposal.




		Introduction

  Clay minerals of the smectite group are important
components of many geologic systems. In addition, they
have highly diverse applications in industry, ranging from
pharmaceutical use to purifying agents to backfill in
radioactive (and other) waste disposal sites. Further-
more, they and other diagenetic clays occur as cements
and pore obstructions in sandstones and may modify the
composition and quantity of pore fluids~ the presence of
these clays are important in both petroleum exploration
and in well completion and stimulation. The varied usage
of smectites is a consequence of their properties such as
compaction, plasticity, catalytic activity, swelling, ion
exchange, density and many others. These are deter-
mined by the nature of the interlayer material in smec-
tites. This interlayer material (cations and water held
between the relatively rigid sheets of tetrahedrally-coor-
dinated and octahedrally-coordinated atoms comprising
the 2:1 layer), readily interacts with the environment and
generally determines its properties. The stability of the
interlayer material with respect to temperature and pres-
sure, therefore, is of great importance in many disci-
plines.
  Whereas the effect of temperature on the interlayer
dehydration of smectites has been studied extensively,
the effect of pressure is not well established. Much of the
information available is from drill cuttings and drill cores




(Whittaker and Dyson, 1980) on the basis of the clay
mineralogy, but it is difficult to separate the effect of
pressure from that of temperature or of the fixation of
potassium (which produces illite or illite/smectite mixed-
layer clays) from drill core studies alone. Nevertheless, it
is generally agreed that in an open system much of the
interlayer water is easily removed by pressure, with the
exception of either the last or last two hydration layers
(Whittaker and Dyson, 1980). For example, van Olphen
(1963) has calculated that in Ca-bentonites a load of
37,000 p.s.i. is required to remove the next to last water
interlayer and 99,000 p.s.i. for the last interlayer. An
experimental study (Khitarov and Pugin, 1966) indicates
that pressure does not significantly increase the stability
of the interlayer water in smectites. This is at variance
with other experimental studies on smectites, which show
that these clays are stable to temperatures of 400 to 500~C
and pressures of 0.5 and 2 kbar (Eberl et al., 1978). Eberl
et al. point out that increased water pressure should
increase dioctahedral smectite stability in hydrotherm~~
systems with a 1:1 ratio of smectite to pure water. These
results suggest that the more modest pressures fro~
overburden are generally insufficient to cause los~~~~
water from the last hydration shells.
