STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY

General Statement

  Three structural features of regional sig-
nificance are discussed and interpreted in rela-
tion to the structure of the Specter Range
Quadrangle: (1) the Las Vegas Valley Shear
Zone that enters the Specter Range quadrangle
from the southeast, (2) the extension of the
Johnnie thrust, and (3) three sets of high-angle
faults. Because these structures are of regional
importance, the data obtained within the
Specter Range quadrangle will be presented as
a basis for a regional structural interpretation.
  The most characteristic structural features
of the Specter Range quadrangle are the high-
angle faults, many of which are topographically
expressed; folding is relatively unimportant
and local. The high-angle faults are grouped
into three sets on the basis of similar strike:
(1) a northwest set which strikes N 20~-60~
W., averaging N. 40~-45~ W., (2) a north-south
set whose strike ranges from N. 30~ W. to
N. 35~ E., averaging N. 0~-5~ E., and (3) a
northeast set which strikes from N. 35~ E. to
east-west, averaging N. 60~-65~ E. (see Fig. 1).
They are called high-angle faults rather than
normal faults here because the observed
stratigraphic displacements can be explained
by either dip-slip or strike-slip movements.
The high-angle faults are superposed on older
folds and faults which are related to the Late
Mesozoic and Early Tertiary deformation that
affected the eastern part of the Basin and Range
province.
  The bedrock of the Specter Range quadran-
gle can be conveniently divided into six struc-
tural blocks (Fig. 2). Structures and trends are
similar within each block, but differ from those
of adjacent blocks; the relationships between
blocks are not all clear.

Block I

  Block I, in the northeast quarter of the
quadrangle (Fig. 2), consists of a large area
underlain by rocks of the Oak Springs Group
of Tertiary age and three discontinuous areas
of Paleozoic rocks northeast of the Specter
Range and the northeast-trending ridges north
of Camp Desert Rock. Block I is the simplest
structural block and shows the clearest sequence
of faulting.
