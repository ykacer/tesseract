  Some commenters suggested that the
regulation should be amended to require
that DOE may not proceed to 
characterize sites by sinking shafts until
NRC and State review and comment
upon the SCP are complete.  One
commenter suggested that the regulation
be clarified to specify that completion of
NRC review is not a condition precedent
for shaft sinking.  The Commission
agrees with the commenters who regard
NWPA as requiring that DOE defer the
sinking of shafts at least until such time
as there has been an opportunity for
pertinent comments on shaft sinking to
have been solicited and considered by
DOE.  As stated in the preamble to the
proposed rule, "The Commission
believes that Congress intended that
DOE should provide the plans
sufficiently far in advance so that
comments may be developed and
submitted back to DOE early enough to
be considered when shaft sinking
occurs, and all times thereafter."  The
question, therefore, is not whether the
Commission agrees with the objective of
those commenters to defer shaft sinking
until after comments on the SCP have
been received by DOE.  The issue,
rather, was whether the Commission
should include in its own regulations an
interpretation of the obligations of DOE
under the statute.  The Commission has
concluded that it should do so, in the
interests of fulfilling its own
responsibilities more effectively.  The
Commission has stressed the
importance of evaluating alternatives to
major design features that are important
to waste isolation, see 10 CFR
~0.21(c)(1)(ii)(D), and in the case of the
design and location of the shafts this
can only be done prior to their sinking.  It
is important to the Commission that the
comments which it may provide to DOE
