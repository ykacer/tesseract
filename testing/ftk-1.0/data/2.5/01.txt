882	E. BLACKWELDER-~SIERRA NEVADA PLEISTOCENE




United States, that Matthes (1931) has adopted that name for the ~~~~~~
epoch in the Yosemite region. For the present, however, it seems ~~~~
to retain a local name; and none of the names available seems more ~~~~~
able than Tioga, for a glacier of this age occupied Tioga Pass and ~~~
lobes descended both southwest and northeast therefrom, leaving charac-
teristic moraines and lakes. East slope localities where the moraines o~
this epoch are well displayed are Convict Lake, June Lake, Grant ~~~~~
Leevining Canyon, Twin Lakes (Bridgeport Basin), Fallen Leaf L~~~~
and Donner Lake west of Truckee.
  The glacial features that were made by the ice tongues of the Tiog~
epoch are even now almost as fresh and unaltered as at the time of their
formation. The cirques are still as bare and ragged as if recently ab~~~
doned by the ice. Talus cones are few and small where the rocks are not
closely jointed, and have not grown to large size even where the closer
spacing of joints is favorable to frost action. The original polished and
striated surface is still rather generally intact, even on such easily weath-
ered rocks as coarse granite. Acres of polished and grooved rock are a
familiar sight near Tenaya Lake (Yosemite National Park) and many
other places in the high Sierra. If it were not for the destructive effects
of forest fires, such surfaces would be even more completely preserved.
  The lateral moraines generally stand out as bold embankments, marred
only by a few landslides and by sharp ravines where tributary brooks
descend the canyon sides. The terminal moraines are still complete, ex-
cept for V-shaped notches through which the main streams tumble
down to the plains beyond. As the distinctive glacial topography of the
moraines is almost entirely preserved, it is generally an easy task to map
them continuously.
  Most of the valleys that were inhabited by glaciers of the fourth epoch
now contain clear lakes 50 to 300 feet deep, some of which are a mile or
more in length. The bouldery slopes commonly descend steeply into the
water. Deltas at the upper ends of these lakes have grown forward only
a small fraction of the original length of the lake, and the outlet streams
have incised their morainic dams only 10-75 feet. Fallen Leaf Lake,
near Lake Tahoe, held in by a compound loop of terminal moraines, is the
largest lake of this type on the eastern slope of the range. Independence,
Convict, and Donner lakes are similar. Only a few of the smaller and
shallower lakes of this age have already disappeared. The rock-bound
mountain tarns in the upper parts of the glacial troughs, largely sur-
rounded by bare ice-scored rock mounds, are in substantially the same
condition now as when the glaciers left them.
