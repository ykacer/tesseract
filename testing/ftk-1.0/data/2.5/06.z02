analysis.)
  To furnish additional assurance to the
~~~t State and affected Indian Tribes
that their views will be considered in 
NRC's preparation of its SCA, a
provision has been added to the final
regulation providing an opportunity,
before publication of the SCA by NRC,
for those parties to present their views
on the DOE SCP and suggestions with
respect to NRC comments thereon.

~. Site Selection Information

  Some commenters opposed the
deletion of information concerning
DOE's site screening and selection
process from the SCP contents.  Some
commenters also commented
unfavorably on a perceived lack of any
NRC review of DOE's site screening and
selection process.  A few commenters
supported the deletion of such 
information from the SCPs.
  The Commission has carefully
reviewed the arguments presented by
the commenters who stated that site
selection information should still be
included in the SCPs.  The Commission
continues to believe that such
information is neither appropriate nor
required in an SCP.
  In regard to the generalized concern
~~~t NRC should be involved in the site
selection process, it is noted that the
NRC has played an important role in
~~~~ process and will continue to do so.
~~~ sites under consideration for
~~~~~~tion have been the subject of
continuous scrutiny by the NRC staff to
identify licensing issues at the earliest
possible stage.  Available data are
examined on a regular basis and site
specific documents such as the
environmental assessments are carefully
reviewed.  There are also activities
specified by the NWPA which afford the
NRC an opportunity to directly influence
the site selection process.  These are
NRC concurrence in DOE's siting
guidelines and review and comments on
the site characterization plans.  NRC
expects that, under the EIS scoping
process pursuant to CEQ rules, DOE will
keep NRC fully and currently informed 
of its plans for implementation.  We also
expect to review and comment on DOE's
scoping documents and activities for
implementing NEPA in the repository
program which are to be developed
~~rsuant to CEQ rules, and to comment
on DOE's EIS.
  Thus, the issue of concern in this 
rulemaking is not whether the
Commission should be involved in the
DOE site screening and selection
process generally.  It is, more
specifically, the scope of the information
~o be included in the DOE submission.
