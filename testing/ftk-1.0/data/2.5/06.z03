The NWPA, while generally conforming
to the earlier NRC regulation, omitted
the provisions dealing with NRC review
of site selection matters.  The
Commission construes this action as an
indication that the site selection issues
previously dealt with in Part 60 were to
be separated from the site
characterization reports and dealt with,
instead, in the environmental
assessments.  Under the NWPA, the
Commission's role in the review of
DOE's site characterization plans is to
determine whether they are appropriate
in light of the Commission's regulations.
Attention will be directed toward the
adequate of the characterization of a
particular site: and this is different from, 
and not dependent upon, the
considerations that led to the selection
of that site.
