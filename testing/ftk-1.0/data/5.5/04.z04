parasite last spring. Nearly
2,000 people suffered bouts
of severe diarrhea, and one
died. (The deaths of five people
already suffering fatal diseases
may have been hastened, as
well.) Cryptosporidium has
sickened other communities,
too, in Georgia, Texas, Penn-
sylvania, and Oregon.
  The parasite is carried by
mammals, particularly young
livestock. Runoff washes ex-
creted cryptosporidium "eggs,"
or cysts, into lakes and rivers.
Most municipalities draw their
water from these surface sup-
plies. To make matters worse,
the cysts are difficult to detect
by current tests, and they with-
stand large doses of chlorine.
  Filtering the water is effec-
tive, but not perfect. In Mil-
waukee, it's believed workers
at one plant added too little
of a compound needed to bind
contaminants into easily re-
moved clumps, allowing large
numbers of cysts to slip past
the filters. Researchers at the
federal Environmental Protec-
tion Agency and elsewhere
say the normal concentration
is closer to one cyst in every
100 liters of filtered water.
