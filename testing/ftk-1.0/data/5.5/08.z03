Democratic, working-class families. Econ-
omists say its proposal to require business
to help pay for workers' insurance would
eat into wages as well.
  The administration has relied so far on
direct subsidies to offset higher costs and
give a more progressive cast to its pack-
age. But this approach would be expensive.
The idea of trimming tax benefits instead,
and recycling the savings to help lower-
income families pay health bills, strikes
many as more efficient.
  Despite labor's blue-collar rhetoric in
favor of the tax shelter for health benefits,
most studies show that the current ar-
rangement really does favor the wealthy.
The Congressional Budget Office last
month estimated that the tax break for a
family earning $20,000 to $30,000 averages
$500 a year, compared with $1,590 for those
earning $75,000 to $100,000.
  But the tax break is difficult to attack
because so many households share in the
benefit; while the rich get more in dollars,
the shelter also is important to the far more
numerous middle-income families. The
CBO report shows the average benefit is a
strikingly consistent 2.3% of after-tax in-
come for families with income of $20,000 to
$100,000.
  Ultimately, the debate may turn on
where to cut off the tax break and how to
recycle the resulting revenue. While the
Heritage plan would do away with the
shelter entirely for individuals, several
variations would set a cap on the employer 
or employee side of the ledger, or both. A
plan proposed by Rep. Jim McCrery (R.,
La.), for instance, would limit the tax
exclusion for individuals, and the tax
deduction for employers, to $2,500 for an
adult or $5,000 for a family.
  A $5,000 cap wouldn't affect a worker
making $40,000 a year with $5,000 in family
health benefits. A $4,000 cap, by contrast,
would cost such a worker $150 more in
taxes, assuming a 15% tax rate.

Progressive Phasing Out

  One option for Democrats would be to
phase out the tax preferences at higher-
income levels. Individuals earning $40,000
or less could be left untouched, for in-
stance, and the exclusion could be progres-
sively reduced at higher income levels
