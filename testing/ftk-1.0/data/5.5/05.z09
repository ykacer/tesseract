To evaluate environmental claims,
look for product labels with specific
information about the product or its
packaging. For example, if a label
says recycled, check how much of the
product or packaging is recycled.
  A growing number of labels on
recycled products tell where the recy-
cled material comes from. Post-Con-
sumer material comes from previous-
ly used business and consumer
products such as newspapers, plastic
bottles, glass containers and alu-
minum cans. Pre-Consumer material,
in contrast, is basically manufacturing
waste. For example, an envelope man-
ufacturer might take the clippings left
over when envelopes are cut from
paper and recycle them into other
paper products.
  Recyclable on the label means the
item can be collected and made into
useful products. This is relevant to
you, however, only if the material is
collected for recycling in your com-
munity. Contact your local recycling
office, trash-collection company or
scrap dealer for this information.
  Biodegradable materials like food
and leaves, when exposed to air,
moisture, and bacteria or other organ-
isms, break down and decompose into
elements found in nature. Pho-
todegradable materials, usually plas-
tics, disintegrate into smaller pieces
when exposed to enough sunlight.
  Either way, degradation of any
