ARE MILWAUKEE-TYPE
PARASITES FLOATING IN
MY DRINKING WATER?




MAYBE. In a recent sur-
vey of drinking water
supplies in 14 states, re-
searchers found one in
four to be tainted with 
Cryptosporidium par-
vum. Luckily, it takes a
lot of the bugs to make
you sick, and there are
ways you can keep them
out of your tap water.
  Milwaukee's water
system was contaminat-
ed by this tiny intestinal




parasite last spring. Nearly
2,000 people suffered bouts
of severe diarrhea, and one
died. (The deaths of five people
already suffering fatal diseases
may have been hastened, as
well.) Cryptosporidium has
sickened other communities,
too, in Georgia, Texas, Penn-
sylvania, and Oregon.
  The parasite is carried by
mammals, particularly young
livestock. Runoff washes ex-
creted cryptosporidium "eggs,"
or cysts, into lakes and rivers.
Most municipalities draw their
water from these surface sup-
plies. To make matters worse,
the cysts are difficult to detect
by current tests, and they with-
stand large doses of chlorine.
  Filtering the water is effec-
tive, but not perfect. In Mil-
waukee, it's believed workers
at one plant added too little
of a compound needed to bind
contaminants into easily re-
moved clumps, allowing large
numbers of cysts to slip past
the filters. Researchers at the
federal Environmental Protec-
tion Agency and elsewhere
say the normal concentration
is closer to one cyst in every
100 liters of filtered water.




Since it's estimated that 1,000
cysts are needed to breach the
immune defenses of a healthy
adult (perhaps slightly fewer
for a child), you'd have to
drink truckloads of filtered
water a day to become ill.
  Unfiltered water is safe, too,
if it comes from naturally pure
aquifers or sealed wells or if
it meets "filtration avoidance




criteria" set by the EPA, which
include standards for keeping
the watershed clean.
  But 8 percent of Americans
drink unfiltered water from
surface sources, many of which
don't meet the EPA's require-
ments. Your water depart-
ment can tell you about your
supply. If it's neither filtered
nor drawn from a demonstra-
bly pure source, you are vul-
nerable to cryptosporidium.
  The simplest solution: At-
tach a filter to your tap. You'll
need one that removes orga-
nisms as small as 2 microns.
Be sure to change the device
weekly or, for greater ease,
attach a pre-filter to catch
bigger particles, like rust, that
can gunk up the works.

for major reconstruction that
usually costs $3,000 to $5,000
and means being out of action
for months. It's becoming rou-
tine for doctors to suggest
surgery to active patients un-
der 40, because experience
has shown that rehabilitation
alone will leave them frustrat-
ed, unable to return to playing
as hard as they did before.
  Physicians haven't been sure,
though, of the best course of
action for middle-aged pa-
tients. Orthopedic surgeon
Michael Ciccotti and his col-
leagues at Thomas Jefferson
University surveyed 52 patients
who had torn a ligament be-
tween the ages of 40 and 60
and opted against reconstruc-
tion. Several years later, he
found, 85 percent were satis-
fied with rehabilitation alone.
  The older patients were
more willing than younger
ones to live with slightly
weakened knees because most
weren't playing sports as in-
tensely as they might have a
decade or two before. But they
also got better results without
surgery, says Ciccotti, because
they were more apt to wear
their knee braces and do their
exercises. Almost all of them
returned to playing sports,
just easing up a little.
  An over-40 ski jumper or
tennis pro might not be so
satisfied. "To return to com-
petitive, highly pivoting
sports, they might want to
consider surgery," says
Ciccotti. "But in general,
middle-aged people don't
need knee reconstruction."




Chewing Away
Tooth Decay

NEW HAVEN, CONN.-~Chew
on this: Xylitol gum can re-
verse dental damage. A study
of children who chewed gum




containing the natural sweet-
ener found that they had fewer
cavities after about two years
than when they started.
  Researchers already knew
that chewing xylitol gum
helps prevent cavities. Any
gum has a protective effect
because it stimulates saliva,
which washes away some
cavity-causing bacteria and
contains minerals that teeth
need to harden soft spots. But
regular gum contains sugar
that feeds bacteria, neutraliz-
ing saliva's benefits. Xylitol
slows bacterial growth, allow-
ing saliva to do its job.
  Now it seems that the gum
does more than merely pro-
tect, according to a study
done by University of Michi-
gan dental biochemist Kauko
M~~~kinen. M~~~kinen and his
colleagues asked 1,000 chil-
dren in Belize to chew gum
containing either xylitol, sug-
ar, or sorbitol-~another nat-
ural sweetener-~three to five




   THE MOLE
  THAT KILLS

Skin cancer can be deadly
if it's not caught early. Tell
your doctor if any spot on
your skin shows the A, B,
C, and D of malignant
melanoma.

A IS FOR ASYMMETRY
One half does not match
the other.

B IS FOR BORDER
The edges are ragged,
notched, or blurred.

C IS FOR COLOR
The pigmentation is not
uniform.

D IS FOR DIAMETER
The spot is about the size
of a pencil eraser.
