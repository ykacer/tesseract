   THE MOLE
  THAT KILLS

Skin cancer can be deadly
if it's not caught early. Tell
your doctor if any spot on
your skin shows the A, B,
C, and D of malignant
melanoma.

A IS FOR ASYMMETRY
One half does not match
the other.

B IS FOR BORDER
The edges are ragged,
notched, or blurred.

C IS FOR COLOR
The pigmentation is not
uniform.

D IS FOR DIAMETER
The spot is about the size
of a pencil eraser.
