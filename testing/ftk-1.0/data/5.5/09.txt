  Eldorado Rand group. The Eldorado Rand group (No. 188, pl. 2)
comprises three patented claims and 24 unpatented claims. The bulk of the
production, amounting to perhaps $1,000,000, has been from two of the
patented claims, the Quaker City and the Rand. There are approximately
6,000 feet of underground workings on the Quaker City claim, including the
350-foot Rand shaft. The workings explore veins in quartz monzonite.
  The Quaker City claim is 1.75 miles west of Nelson, near the head of
Eldorado Canyon. According to Ransome (1907, p. 77), "At the Quaker
City there are two parallel, nearly horizontal veins about 100 feet apart, the
upper one being exposed along the hillside for at least 1,200 feet. The average
dip of these veins is 15~, in a direction a little east of north. They have been
extensively stoped, in many places to a height of 7 feet . . . The ore consists
of shattered quartz monzonite which has been cemented and partly replaced
by calcite and quartz. Originally the deposit contained finely disseminated
pyrite, but this is now oxidized and the material is a free-milling gold ore."
  The Rand shaft, near the Quaker City workings, explores a vein that
strikes N. 70~ E. and dips 80~ N. Ransome (1907, p. 77) stated, "The vein is
tight and consists of little bunches and veinlets of quartz, calcite, and pyrite
in a somewhat pyritized quartz monzonite. The lode has produced some
oxidized ore from old workings near the surface . . ."
  The Honest Miner claim, a short distance east of the Rand and Quaker
City, is reportedly the claim on which gold was first discovered in this dis-
trict (Ransome, 1907, p. 76). The workings explore two nearly parallel
northeast-striking veins about 60 feet apart which dip 45~ NW. cutting fine-
grained quartz monzonite. Ransome (1907, p. 77) reported that ore was
produced from the upper parts of the veins. The vein material consists of
quartz and calcite with specks of limonite.

                         Copper King District

Location
  The Copper King (Key West, Bunkerville) district is in the Virgin
Mountains, in T. 15 S., R. 70 E. The principal properties in the district
(pl. 12) lie about 10 miles south of the town of Bunkerville, Nevada. Bunk-
erville is on old U. S. Highway 91, 33 miles east from the Union Pacific
Railroad station at Moapa, Nevada.

History and production
  Copper ore was discovered in the area in the late 90's, and later the ore
was also found to contain traces of nickel and platinum. Through the years
several unsuccessful attempts have been made to recover these metals. The
most recent mining activity in the district has been confined to the develop-
ment of tungsten and mica-beryl (see p. 159) deposits (Beal, 1965).
  Recorded production, from 1908 to 1962, has been about 3,500 tons of ore
