include standards for keeping
the watershed clean.
  But 8 percent of Americans
drink unfiltered water from
surface sources, many of which
don't meet the EPA's require-
ments. Your water depart-
ment can tell you about your
supply. If it's neither filtered
nor drawn from a demonstra-
bly pure source, you are vul-
nerable to cryptosporidium.
  The simplest solution: At-
tach a filter to your tap. You'll
need one that removes orga-
nisms as small as 2 microns.
Be sure to change the device
weekly or, for greater ease,
attach a pre-filter to catch
bigger particles, like rust, that
can gunk up the works.
