containing the natural sweet-
ener found that they had fewer
cavities after about two years
than when they started.
  Researchers already knew
that chewing xylitol gum
helps prevent cavities. Any
gum has a protective effect
because it stimulates saliva,
which washes away some
cavity-causing bacteria and
contains minerals that teeth
need to harden soft spots. But
regular gum contains sugar
that feeds bacteria, neutraliz-
ing saliva's benefits. Xylitol
slows bacterial growth, allow-
ing saliva to do its job.
  Now it seems that the gum
does more than merely pro-
tect, according to a study
done by University of Michi-
gan dental biochemist Kauko
M~~~kinen. M~~~kinen and his
colleagues asked 1,000 chil-
dren in Belize to chew gum
containing either xylitol, sug-
ar, or sorbitol-~another nat-
ural sweetener-~three to five
