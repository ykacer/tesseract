  WASHINGTON -~ Conservative Repub-
licans are sounding an old-fashioned Dem-

pile of money, it's just an easy target."
Union leaders have begun a letter-writing
campaign aimed at Ways and Means
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) and
his Senate Finance counterpart, Chairman
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.).
  Still, taxing health benefits, for the
wealthy at least, was among the options
discussed by House Ways and Means Com-
mittee Democrats last week. And pro-labor
lawmakers showed support for the idea in
the panel's health subcommittee last
month.
  The White House has kept a low profile
on the tax issue. Many of its health-care
financing options, such as cigarette and
payroll taxes, would fall heavily on largely
