for major reconstruction that
usually costs $3,000 to $5,000
and means being out of action
for months. It's becoming rou-
tine for doctors to suggest
surgery to active patients un-
der 40, because experience
has shown that rehabilitation
alone will leave them frustrat-
ed, unable to return to playing
as hard as they did before.
  Physicians haven't been sure,
though, of the best course of
action for middle-aged pa-
tients. Orthopedic surgeon
Michael Ciccotti and his col-
leagues at Thomas Jefferson
University surveyed 52 patients
who had torn a ligament be-
tween the ages of 40 and 60
and opted against reconstruc-
tion. Several years later, he
found, 85 percent were satis-
fied with rehabilitation alone.
  The older patients were
more willing than younger
ones to live with slightly
weakened knees because most
weren't playing sports as in-
tensely as they might have a
decade or two before. But they
also got better results without
surgery, says Ciccotti, because
they were more apt to wear
their knee braces and do their
exercises. Almost all of them
returned to playing sports,
just easing up a little.
  An over-40 ski jumper or
tennis pro might not be so
satisfied. "To return to com-
petitive, highly pivoting
sports, they might want to
consider surgery," says
Ciccotti. "But in general,
middle-aged people don't
need knee reconstruction."
