   Scalp reduction is often done in con-
junction with tissue expansion. Here bal-
loons are inserted under hair-bearing areas
of scalp and filled with salt water (or-~until
recently at least-~liquid silicone) to stretch
them. Then the bald areas are cut away. Hair
plugs can be used to fill in the now-smaller
areas of baldness and to cover scars.
   With any surgery comes pain, swelling,
numbness, waiting, inconvenience and cost.
Surgery also has the ever-present risk of
infection, and it may fail due to the death of
transplanted tissues, to the creeping expan-
sion of the balding area, or both.
   
Nonmedical Solutions. There are cheaper,
safer ways to deal with baldness. Depending
on the size of the bald area, it can be cov-
ered with a hairpiece or toupee, a wig, or a
hat. There are also techniques that weave
synthetic fibers with natural hair on the
scalp and create the illusion that hair is
growing there. However, adjustments must
be made as the hair anchoring the weaved
addition grows out. Furthermore, it's recom-
mended, the hair addition should be worn no
more than eight weeks at a time, followed
by a "rest period." This is to allow recovery
from traction (pulling) stress on the anchor-
ing hair shafts, which otherwise might kill
the follicles. Nor should a hair addition ever
be sutured to the scalp, a method that com-
monly leads to infection and that is con-
demned by physicians and the American
Hair Loss Council (800/274-8717).
   Hair growing on the fringes of the bald
area can be grown long and combed over to
cover it. There are sprays that adhere to hair
so as to thicken it, thus allowing it to pro-
vide more ample cover. There are also
sprays for coloring the nude scalp so that at
a distance it looks like hair. But up close it
looks silly.
   Then there is the negative approach. As
Dr. Nathaniel Morgan, a dermatologist with
Humana Michael Reese Health Plan (HMO)
in Chicago advises, "The best idea is to go
along with it. Do nothing. Anything you do
is not cost-effective." You could also do
what Michael Jordan does, and shave your
head, or, as Caesar did, put a laurel wreath
on it.                                 ~~
