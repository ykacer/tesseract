1    and bore hole geophysical surveys would be available.

2    If that would read, instead of geophysical surveys, it

3    would read the driller logs, lithologic and geophysical

4    logs and core photographs will be available.

5              MR. BAILLIEUL:  I would have absolutely no

6    problem will pulling that out.

7              MR. ALEXANDER:  Alright, let's move on.  We

10    address the easiest one first and that is the second item,

11    turning our request  for the determination of the likelihood

12    of undiscovered wells in the area.  We agree that that's

13    somewhat speculative.  We would like to get a little

14    better, a little more quantative background, quantative

15    information on that.

16              We would agree with your revisions on insert

17    to sentence one in section 1.6 on the completeness of

18    the historical record examined--if you would add after

19    completeness the word and reliability, so that it would

20    read the completeness and reliability of the historical

21    record examined--

22              MR. ALEXANDER:  I think before we are able to

23    do that, we'd need some clarification on what we mean

24    by reliability.  If you mean that we need to assess a

25    probablistic sense--
