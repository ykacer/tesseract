western blocks.

1.	Solitario Canyon Block. This block is characterized by north-
	northeast-trending tectonic breccia zones as much as 30 m wide. These
	alternate with zones of closely spaced normal faults, 1 to 50 m apart,
	which have displacements from a few centimeters to as much as 250 m.
	Only representative faults can be shown on the geologic maps (Figure
	5) and on Figure 30. The dip of the faults generally is 60~ to 70~ W.
	(range: 35~ to 80~ W.), but several faults dip steeply eastward. The
	frequency and displacement of fault and breccia zones decrease north-
	ward toward the head of Solitario Canyon, where individual faults
	coalesce into a single 20-m-wide fault zone with less than 30 m of
	vertical displacement. The easternmost of these faults, called the
	Solitario Canyon fault, forms the western boundary of the potential
	repository. Attitudes of bedding and foliation planes defined by
	welded pumice fragments range from horizontal to steeply overturned.
	Nearly all of the faults developed before deposition of the Rainier
	Mesa Member of the Timber Mountain Tuff (11.3 m.y. ago), but at least
	one fault along the southwest edge of the Site cuts Quaternary allu-
	vial deposits.

2.	Central Block. A scarcity of large-displacement faults and a uniform
	5~ to 10~ eastward dip of beds characterize this block (Figure 5).
	Two north-northeast-striking normal faults of small displacement cut
	the block near Drill Hole Wash. The easternmost of these can be
	traced approximately 2.5 km southward from the wash, where it splays
	into a series of north-northeast-striking faults. This fault has as
	much as 14 m displacement. The westernmost fault, which extends into
	the northern block, can be traced for approximately 1.5 km and has as
	much as 5 m of displacement. Fractures striking about N10~W to N20~W
	and dipping 80~SW are widespread. Other fractures striking north to
	north 20~ east and dipping steeply northwest and southeast are present
	but less common. In the southern half of the block, normal faults,
	spaced 30 to 100 m apart and with apparent displacements of less than
	3 m, occur parallel to the northwest-striking fractures. Near the
