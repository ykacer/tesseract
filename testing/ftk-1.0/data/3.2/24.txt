1. Volume I	Interagency Coordination. The Draft refers to the
   2-11; 3-C-3;	Procedural Agreement on packaging certification
   3-C-4	signed by the DOE and NRC (48 Fed. Reg. 51875,
		November 14, 1983) and refers to strengthened
   Volume II	coordination with other Federal agencies,
   10-16 to 17	including the DOT and FEMA. The Group believes
		that DOE should clarify how it will improve
		coordination with other Federal agencies and what
		issues will be addressed, e.g. inspections;
		prenotifications; insurance/indemnity; fees;
		emergency response; risk assessments; data
		collection; and cost/benefit calculations. For
		example, will there be a memorandum of under-
		standing with DOT and an updating of the Federal
		Radiological Emergency Response Plan? How will
		DOE, DOT and NRC coordinate research and
		development activities to address issues of common
		concern? How will DOE assure itself that it is
		aware of actions by other Federal agencies
		that affect DOE's responsibilities, e.g. NRC's
		and DOT's plans regarding changes in criteria
		for certifying casks and any program to engage
		in destructive testing of models or casks?
		The need for increased attention to these
		matters was highlighted by the May 17, 1984
		decision by an ICC Review Board in Docket No.
		37891S and related dockets dealing with rail rates
		for hauling loaded and empty spent fuel casks.
		In the Group's view, the Review Board ignored
		the implications of its decision with respect to
		effective implementation of DOE's responsibilities
		under the NWPA. Finally, how will DOE help assure
		that electric utilities, cask vendors and carriers
		are kept advised of important developments
		affecting transportation that result from
		interagency communications?

2. Volume I	Generic Reviews of Transportation Issues.
   3-C-2	It should be a fundamental objective of DOE's
		policy that important safety, environmental and
		economic issues affecting transportation be
		resolved in generic proceedings rather than
		being addressed in reviews of specific ship-
		ments. Efforts to require movement-specific
		analyses of the "need" for and safety of
		specific shipments are inconsistent with safe
		and efficient transportation in support of the
		operation of nuclear power plants and are a burden
		on interstate commerce. As a corollary of this
		principle, the range of discretion allowed for
		imposing requirements on individual shipments
		should be narrowly circumscribed and clearly
