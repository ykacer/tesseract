  HONG KONG -~ The ceremonial
changing of the guard took place high
above Hong Kong harbor, in one of the
glass-enclosed aeries reserved for the
colony's business elite.
  Simon Murray, a feisty Scotsman in
the long tradition of British colonial
traders here, reluctantly handed
over his job last fall as managing
director of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.,
the venerable British merchant trad-
ing house, to Canning Fok, a low-
profile Chinese accountant from
Hong Kong.
  The switch on the 22nd floor of
Hutchison House ended a boardroom
debate about the company's direc-
tion and signaled a scramble among
the powerful "hongs" to shed their
British veneer before China takes
over in three years.
  Since 1979, Hutchison, founded by
a colonial class that once banned
Chinese from its country clubs, had
been controlled by Hong Kong bil-
lionaire Li Ka-shing. Li, known for
his solid business ties with the com-
munist leadership in Beijing, wanted
Hutchison to concentrate on its trade
with mainland China. Murray, al-
though bullish on China, pushed to
maintain the company's business
connections with the West through
investments in Britain and Canada.
  Murray also presented another prob-
lem: He supported the democratic re-
forms proposed for Hong Kong by Brit-
ish colonial Gov. Chris Patten, the
bane of the Beijing regime.
  When the dust settled, Murray was
out. For the first time in its history,
Hutchison was to be managed by a
Chinese executive. Unequivocally, the
main business of Hutchison would be
China. There would be no more ques-
tion of supporting Patten's reforms.
