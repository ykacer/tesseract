1    and bore hole geophysical surveys would be available.

2    If that would read, instead of geophysical surveys, it

3    would read the driller logs, lithologic and geophysical

5              MR. BAILLIEUL:  I would have absolutely no

21    record examined--

22              MR. ALEXANDER:  I think before we are able to

25    probablistic sense--
