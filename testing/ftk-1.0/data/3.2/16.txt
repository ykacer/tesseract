  In this chapter, the mechanical, thermal, and thermomechanical properties
of the rock units and the expected parameter ranges that are the basis for the
conceptual design of the geologic repository should be presented. Each dis-
cussion should include a brief summary of generic information from similar
rock units and projects and site-specific information,* if available. The
information should be in sufficient detail to (1) permit an understanding
of the geomechanical basis of the proposed conceptual design of a repository
appropriate to the site (Chapter 6) and (2) support the discussion of design
issues in Part B. The discussions should include values or ranges of values
for the design parameters used in the conceptual design and should provide the
rationale for selecting these preliminary values.

  For each of the properties of the rock units, include a discussion of the
equipment and procedures used, including their limitations and the errors
produced by them. (Equipment and procedures should be referenced to the appro-
priate standards, e.g., ASTM, where available.) Geologic borehole logs, geologic
cross sections, or photographs accumulated during preliminary site exploration
activities should be provided when possible to show where tests were conducted
or samples were taken. Any measures taken to preserve or restore the in situ
chemical and physical environment during site exploration should be described.
The anisotropy of the properties should be addressed. If isotropic approxima-
tions are assumed, justify that assumption.

            2.1 Mechanical Properties of Rock Units - Continua

Present the mechanical properties of the rock units as determined by labo-
ratory tests on intact samples of the potential host rock and of other rock
units important for the conceptual design of a repository appropriate to the
site and its performance if available. Also present available generic data
from similar rock units. Include site-specific information, when available, on
elastic and inelastic behavior, time-dependent deformation characteristics,
compressive and tensile strength, and effects of heating and fluid pressure on
these properties.

           2.2 Mechanical Properties of Rock Units - Large Scale

  Present the results of any large-scale laboratory and field tests such as
plate-bearing tests, chamber tests, flat jacks, Goodman jacks, and convergence
tests. ("Large-scale" here means tests of sufficient size to take into account
the discontinua (fractures, joints, inhomogeneities, etc.) of the media.)
Discuss the relationship of the results of the laboratory tests on intact samples
to the results of the large-scale tests. Provide site-specific data, if avail-
able, as well as available generic data for similar rock units and environments.




*Site-specific information means information gained from tests done in, or
samples taken from, limited borings, surface outcrops, near-surface test facil-
ities, pre-existing tunnels or mines, etc., near the site proposed for charac-
terization. It does not imply that a shaft has been sunk.
