effectiveness of these filters has also been proven for aqueous
solutions of neptunium and americium.22,23
  After separation of solution and solid phase the two components
were analyzed separately. Concentration measurements of the
supernatants were made for
  -	243Am and 237Np by counting the 74.67 keV or the 29.34 keV ~-
	ray line with the germanium low-energy ~-counting system,
	respectively;

  -	242,238Pu by ~-liquid scintillation assay.

  The solid compounds were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction
measurements. A few micrograms of each actinide precipitates were
placed in a 0.33 mm diameter quartz capillary tube, and the tube was
sealed with a oxy-butane microtorch. The tube was mounted into an 11.4
cm diameter Debye-Scherrer camera and then irradiated with X-rays from a
Norelco III X-ray generator (both Philips Electronics Inc.). Copper K~
radiation filtered through Ni was used.

2.3.2 Plutonium Polymer

  Since the presence of Pu polymer was expected in the supernatants
of the Pu solutions, we wanted to familiarize ourselves with its
solution properties.
  The Pu(IV) polymer was prepared in an inert-gas atmosphere from
242Pu4+ stock by hydroxide precipitation and redissolution of the
precipitate in a small amount of 6 M HCl. Dilution with distilled, CO2-
free water gave a solution with 1.4 ~ 10-3 M total Pu concentration and
a pH of 1.3. After standing for seven days at room temperature an
