transplanted hair appears more natural.
From 30 to 350 plugs are transplanted at
each two- to three-hour session. One to four
sessions are usually required, scheduled a
month or more apart. Transplanted hair falls
out in a few weeks and comes in fresh in
about three more months, growing at the
same rate as it did before it was moved-~
about half an inch a month. The entire treat-
ment takes from eight to 18 months, which
is one reason it is so pricey (see table).
  Transplanted hair is not forever. At best,
it lasts as long as it would have at the origi-
nal site. Any follicles that are inadvertently
compressed during the process may produce
curly hair, where it was previously straight.
The best candidates for transplantation are:
  ~ Men with receding hairlines and/or
bald spots at the top of the head. Men with
large areas of baldness may not have enough
donor hair to fill in these areas.
  ~ White men with gray, blond, red and
light-brown hair. More dark hair is required
because of the contrast with light skin.
  ~ Men with curly hair, because it covers
so well and stays in the area in which it is
planted. Wavy hair does not give quite as
good results. Straight hair covers least well.
  ~ Men with fine hair. While it doesn't
cover as well as thick hair, fine hair usually
gives a better result because it is more man-
ageable than thick hair strands.
  ~ Men with dense hair. Although when
transplanted, it could look tufted and not
natural, smaller-sized grafts may prevent
this problem.
  The other surgical technique for trans-
planting hair is the "flap." This is usually
performed by a plastic surgeon while the
patient is in an operating room under gener-
al anesthesia. The surgeon cuts a wide strip
of hair-bearing scalp and, leaving a small
"foot" attached to maintain its blood and
nerve supply, rotates it to a denuded area
where a like-size strip of bald scalp has been
removed. After fitting it, the surgeon sutures
the flap to hold it in place. The edges of the
wound left behind are also sutured shut.
Once the flap has established its own blood
supply, the small "foot" is cut away.

Reducing the Bald Spot. Instead of moving
hair into the bald area, the bald area itself
can be reduced. Sometimes called a "hair-
lift," this is done by a plastic surgeon in an
operating room while the patient is under
general anesthesia. An ellipse-shaped piece
of bare scalp about two inches wide and
seven inches long is cut out, and the gaping
edges are brought together and sutured.
After the scalp heals, only a thin line is left.
A series of scalp reductions can be carried
out over a course of many months to keep
reducing the bald area.
