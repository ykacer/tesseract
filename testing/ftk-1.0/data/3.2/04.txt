For example, 10CFR960.4-2-1(d) states that "A site shall be dis-
qualified if the pre-waste-emplacement ground-water travel time
from the disturbed zone to the accessible environment is
expected to be less than 1,000 years along any pathway of likely
and significant radionuclide travel."

1.1.2 Relationship to Site Characterization Plan

  The proposed study is needed in part to fulfil information
need 1.17.2 -- Potential Effects of Future Climatic Conditions
on Hydrologic Characteristics, and it is specifically requested
under study 1.17.2.1 -- Characterization of the Quaternary
Regional Hydrology as activity 1.17.2.1.6 -- Studies of Calcite-
Opaline Silica Vein Deposits. Some of the data obtained during
this study will fulfil part of information need 1.20.2 -- Nature
and Rate of Tectonic Processes, Including Faulting, Folding,
Uplift and Subsidence, and Seismic Activity.

1.1.3 Relation to other programmatic requirements

  A NRC memo of Jan 16, 1986 by John Bradbury and Charlotte
Abrams notes that the origin of the calcite and opaline silica
deposit of Trench 14 "will have direct bearing on the suitabil-
ity of the site for burial of HLW". Representatives of the NRC
and the State of Nevada expressed concerns about the origin of
the deposit at workshops held in Las Vegas, Nevada on Feb. 28,
and April 28, 1986. At the April meeting, representatives of
