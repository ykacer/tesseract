Through the Grapevine
Here's a nice way to wine and dine
your way through Tuscany, Piedmont
and Italy's other gustatory meccas.
Ciclismo Classico conducts bicycle
tours that include private vineyard
visits and serious restaurant going.
Next month's trip includes a stop at
"La Fiera del Vino," a wine festival in
Asti.  Call 800-866-7314 or 617-628-
7314 for more information....For ref-
erence, you might want to take a copy
of The Wine Roads of Italy by Marc
and Kim Millon.  This 529-page paper-
back (HarperCollins, 1993) is packed
with maps and restaurant listings.

Wine of the Month
Count Matuschka-Greiffenclau is an
articulate German vintner who runs
Schloss Vollrads, a historic winery on
the Rhine in the Rheingau.  This
ancient estate has produced wine for
nearly eight hundred years.  In recent
vintages Matuschka has focused on
making well-balanced dry wines that 
retain their fruit.  An excellent example
is the 1990 Schloss Vollrads, Rhein-
gau Riesling, Sp~~~tlese, Rosasilber
(left), a crisp halbtrocken (half dry)
wine that has wonderful orange and
peach flavors.  It's $25 a bottle.

Spirit of the Month
Stubbs is a white rum that differs in a
few ways from its Caribbean cousins.
For one thing, it's made in Queens-
land, Australia.  For another, it's dis-
tilled from the clear, fresh juice of
sugarcane, not from dark molasses.
The result is an exceptionally dry and
elegant spirit that not only mixes 
nicely with tonic but also is delicious
on the rocks.  A real conversation
starter for only $14.~
