master-	Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline master side
slave-	Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline slave side
cf1-	Value of the friction coefficient. if fully fixed use -1.

cf2-	Value of slideline overlap tolerance to determine when contact of
	surfaces does occur.{2% of the Master element side length}
