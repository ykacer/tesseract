  Since the parts of the Permian Basin in western Kansas and Texas and in
eastern Colorado and New Mexico had been screened as part of an earlier site
evaluation for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), this screening focused
on five subbasins:  the Anadarko, Palo Duro, Dalhart, Midland, and Delaware
Basins.  All contain salt beds of adequate thickness and depth.  A site had
already previously been selected in the Delaware Basin as a site for the WIPP
facility for the storage of radioactive defense wastes (DOE, 1980b).  The Palo
Duro and the Dalhart Basins had far less potential for oil and gas production
and have not been penetrated as extensively by drilling as have the Anadarko
and the Midland Basins.  Therefore, the Palo Duro and the Dalhart Basins were
judged to be preferable to the other three and were recommended for further
studies at the area stage (ONWI, 1983b).  These two basins rated higher on six
major screening factors:  the depth and thickness of salt, seismicity, known
oil and gas deposits, the presence of exploratory boreholes, and evidence of
salt dissolution.~

    More-detailed geologic and environmental studies of the Palo Duro and the
Dalhart Basins began in 1977, and screening criteria were developed to define
locations with favorable characteristics.  Six locations in parts of Deaf
Smith, Swisher, Oldham, Briscoe, Armstrong, Randall, and Potter Counties,
Texas, met the screening criteria.  A second set of criteria was then applied
to further differentiate among the six locations.  These criteria reflected
siting factors related to geomorphology, the presence of natural resources,
flexibility in repository siting at specific locations, the number of
boreholes at each location, population density, and land-use conflicts.  After
applying these criteria, the DOE decided to focus on the two locations that
had the greatest likelihood of containing a suitable site, one in northwestern
Deaf Smith and southeastern Oldham Counties and one in northcentral Swisher
County.  All other locations in the Palo Duro Basin were deferred from further
consideration (ONWI, 1983a).  In February 1983, the DOE identified parts of
Deaf Smith County and Swisher County as potentially acceptable sites and
subsequently narrowed the size of the two sites to be considered at each
location (DOE, 1984c).~
