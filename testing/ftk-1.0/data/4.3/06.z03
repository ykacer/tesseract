COLOR US BUSY THIS MONTH:  WE'VE FOUND A GREAT
bike-and-wine trip in Italy, a superb guidebook to go with
it, a spirit from Australia and a crisp, delightful white wine
made at an estate with a seventeenth-century palace overlooking the 
Rhine.  That's a lot of territory to cover on one page.  Have a look.

          The Top 10
     Here are your best bets for the month, selected by the Bon App~~tit
     Tasting Panel, which meets weekly under the direction of wine and
     spirits editor Anthony Dias Blue and his associate, Jack R. Weiner.

     1990 Parducci Wine Cellars, Johannisberg Riesling, North Coast ($6).
          Snappy with lively acidity and fine apple and peach nuances.

     1992 Jacob's Creek, Chardonnay, South Eastern Australia ($8).
     A charming white that's crisp and lively with great clean fruit.

     1991 Prosper Maufoux, C~~tes du Rh~~ne, France ($8).  A dense red wine
     featuring "leathery, black cherry and peppery fruit and a soft finish,"
      says panel member Peter Kay of The Stouffer Stanford Court hotel.
