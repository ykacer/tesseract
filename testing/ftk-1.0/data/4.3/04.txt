   In this chapter, present pertinent descriptions of the geochemical proper-
ties of the rocks, minerals, sediments, and water of the candidate area and
site. Include the anticipated radionuclide transport mechanisms (i.e., liquid
water, vapor, gas) from the canister to the accessible environment and expected
geochemical reactions that have influenced the conceptual design of a repository
appropriate to the site. Also include generic data from similar rock types and
site-specific information, if available. The information should be presented
in sufficient detail to (1) permit an understanding of the geochemical factors
of the candidate area and site based on available literature and site-screening
studies and (2) support the planned site characterization program.

   For each of the following sections, include the rationale for the values
chosen. For natural variables (e.g., rock compositions and ground-water chem-
istry), indicate expected ranges of values and by what process these were assume~
For engineering variables (e.g., composition of backfill, waste form, canister,
temperature, and pressure), indicate why these particular values were assumed
and what is the reasonable range of expected values. For chemical and geo-
chemical reactions (e.g., any of the reactions among the waste, water, vapor,
gas, rock, barrier, canister), indicate the rationale for the identification of
these reactions (e.g., theoretical, laboratory experimental, observed in nature)
and to what extent the nature of the reactions would be expected to change
because of changing conditions at the site (e.g., changes in solubility of
constituents in ground water resulting from heating the ground water).

                       4.1 Host Rock Geochemistry

   For rocks and fracture fill materials along credible pathways to the
accessible environment, describe the petrology and mineralogy of the rocks and
material in the fractures. Describe the inferred and measured distribution
and abundance of mineral phases that will affect radionuclide migration, and
identify inferred and measured mineral assemblages and amorphous components
that buffer pH and Eh of ground water. This description should consider
(1) baseline conditions, (2) the period prior to closure, (3) the period
between closure and release, (4) release and (5) transport.


   For the proposed host rock unit and other rock units along credible pathway~
to the accessible environment, provide the following information when available.

1. Supporting data and analyses determining the geochemical baseline site
   conditions. To the extent reasonable in light of the geologic record, it
   should be assumed that processes operating in the geologic setting during
   the Quaternary Period continue to operate. For example:

   a. Petrology, mineralogy,
   b. Major, minor, and trace-element composition of ground water, including
      organic and inorganic species, dissolved and suspended (i.e., colloids),
   c. Ionic strength of ground water,
   d. Complexing agents (organic and inorganic),
