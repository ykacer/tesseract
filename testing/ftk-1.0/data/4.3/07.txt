SLIDE,[master,slave,cf1,cf2,cf3]

  This card specifies the master/slave connection for any slidelines in
the analysis. A maximum of 12 slidelines is allowed.

master-	Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline master side
slave-	Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline slave side
cf1-	Value of the friction coefficient. if fully fixed use -1.
	Otherwise insert the proper value here. {0.}
cf2-	Value of slideline overlap tolerance to determine when contact of
	surfaces does occur.{2% of the Master element side length}
cf3-	Value of stress for release of slave node from master surface.
	Value is set to no release,a non-zero value is required to activate
	this option. {0.}
