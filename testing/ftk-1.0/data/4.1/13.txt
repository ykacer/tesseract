the U.S. Geological Survey. The plot for well 2 (fig. 23b) suggests
a possible increase in late 1971. Although the data are sparse and
inconclusive, they demand  further consideration. The following 
paragraphs provide a discussion and evaluation of the significance 
of the reported values and the degree of confidence with which the 
increasing trend may be viewed.
     The first consideration concerns sample collection and analysis
procedures.
     (1) Although analytical procedures have changed somewhat during 
1957-71, the same basic planchet preparation procedure and instrument
calibration procedure have remained in use, wherein the same planchet
is used to count both alpha and beta activities. 
     (2) In 1965, collection and field treatment of samples for 
radiochemical analysis were changed (see page 7). The major effect
of this change was to go from collection of unfiltered (or filtered
through paper of unknown pore diameter) samples which had acetic 
acid and chloroform added, to collection of samples filtered through 
a 0.45-micrometer membrane with hydrochloric or nitric acid added.
The effects of these collection procedures on the alpha and beta
values might logically be as follows.
     Unfiltered samples may contain sediment with sorbed alpha or
beta activity. Addition of acid would tend to de-sorb this activity
from the solid phase and thus increase the total activity in solution.
The filtered samples would contain only particulates smaller than the 
maximum pore size of the filter.  For the 0.45-micrometer membrane,
only particles smaller than an average bacterium would pass through.
