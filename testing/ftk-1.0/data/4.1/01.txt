STATEMENT FROM THE 1983 MEETING OF THE ICRP	69




complex interplay of rates of biological uptake and loss, together with radioactive decay in the
many organs and tissues that might determine an ALI, and it would be prudent to consider
carefully each separate case. In fact, relevant data are scarce but the following examples will
serve to illustrate the nature of the problem.
  From considerations of water balance, the mean life of water in the body is about 14 days
for adults and 6 days for infants aged 6 months (ICRP, 1975) and that of the long-lived
radionuclide tritium in the form of tritiated water will have similar values. In consequence, the
committed dose equivalent to body tissues from unit intake of tritium as tritiated water will be
only about four times greater for such infants than for adults, rather than the ten times greater
factor derived above that would be expected on the basis of their differences in mass alone.
Similarly, as a consequence of the more rapid turnover of the long-lived caesium-137 in people
of smaller mass (Cryer and Baverstock, 1972), the committed dose equivalent in body tissues
from unit intake of the radionuclide is only about 1.5 times greater for the 6-month infant than it
is for adults (Medical Research Council, 1975).
  The mean life of iodine in the thyroid also increases with age, but this may be accompanied by
a small decrease in the uptake into the gland from the blood, (Medical Research Council, 1975;
UNSCEAR, 1977; Dunning and Schwarz, 1981; Stather and Greenhalgh, 1983). For the
relatively short-lived radionuclide iodine-131, differences in biological turnover are of little
consequence because its rate of loss from the thyroid is dominated by radioactive decay and its
mean life in that organ is therefore about the same at all ages. In consequence, the committed
dose equivalent to the thyroid per unit intake of iodine-131 is about ten times greater for the
infant aged 6 months than it is for adults (Medical Research Council, 1975), reflecting their
approximately 10-fold difference in thyroid mass. However, for the very long-lived iodine-129,
the more rapid biological turnover in young people tends to offset their smaller mass, and the
committed dose equivalent to the thyroid per unit intake of iodine-129 for the 6-month child is
only about twice that for adults (UNSCEAR, 1977).
  Papworth and Vennart (1973) and Leggett et al. (1982) have described how the uptake of
strontium into bone and its retention therein varies with age. The former authors have given
values for the committed dose equivalent in red bone marrow and on bone surfaces from unit
intake of dietary strontium-90 and strontium-89. For the long-lived strontium-90, the value for
a 6-month infant is about five times the adult value, but for the much shorter-lived strontium-89
the corresponding ratio lies in the range 20-40, the actual value depending on the model used for
the dosimetry of the radionuclide in bone. There may be additional contributions to the
committed effective dose equivalent from other organs and tissues for which the factors might be
different.

Chemical Form

  Values of ALI given in ICRP Publication 30 are usually appropriate to those chemical
compounds of a radionuclide that are most likely to be encountered at a place of work.
Compounds of the same radionuclide found in the environment or in food may be metabolized
differently. The consequent changes in values of committed effective dose equivalent have to be
considered very carefully. For example, increased absorption of a radionuclide from the
gastrointestinal tract into the blood will decrease the committed dose equivalent to the lower
part of the tract, but increase the doses in other tissues of the body; such increases are most
marked when radioactive decay is small during the time taken for transfer from the
gastrointestinal system to the other organs and tissues.
  It is known that absorption of some elements from the gastrointestinal system is increased in
new-born animals of several species by factors up to 100 for compounds that are very poorly
