  TURNERS FALLS, Mass. -~
It's a bumpy ride up a mountain
road to the spotless home of Paul
and Louise Desilets.
  He is a carpet cleaner and local
landlord, devoutly Roman Cath-
olic and contemplative. She
directs Sunday school at Our
Lady of Czestochowa Church. As
a hospice visiting nurse, she com-
forts patients who choose to die
at home.
  But there are certain choices in
life that the Desilets cannot
abide.
  "Allowing fornication to occur
on property I own places my eter-
nal soul at risk," says Paul,
seated in his living room near a
two-foot statue of the Virgin
Mary.
  Instead, Desilets, 41, has put
himself at legal risk by refusing to
rent an apartment to an unmar-
ried couple.
  That would be Mark Lattanzi
and Cynthia Tarail.

Lawsuit's fifth year

  Lattanzi and Tarail's anti-dis-
crimination suit is entering its
fifth year in Massachusetts and is
sparking a national debate about
fair housing, religious freedom
and sexual mores. Twenty-four
groups -~ from Focus on the
Family to Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders -~
have filed friend-of-the-court
briefs in the matter pending
before the state supreme court.

  Lattanzi came to the Connecti-
cut River village of Turners Falls
in 1989 as a Vista worker orga-
nizing tenants to buy buildings
and convert them to cooperative
housing.

  Now, at 27, he is a local coordi-
nator for a private project against
housing discrimination.

  When Lattanzi and Tarail saw
an ad in the local daily newspa-
~ per for a $400-a-month, two-bed-
room apartment, they were inter-
ested. They had been sharing the
rent with a family of four in a
five-room apartment.
