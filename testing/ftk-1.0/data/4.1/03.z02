altitude. The mountains are composed largely of
late Mesozoic granitic, batholiths-~by far the
greatest of the batholiths along the Pacific Coast
of North America, 1,000 miles long and in places
more than 100 miles wide. At many places the
western base of the mountains descends abruptly
to oceanic depths some thousands of feet below
sea level: the relief, therefore, is much greater
than the mountainous heights one sees. At Van-
couver and Queen Charlotte islands and the is-
lands of southeastern Alaska are comparative
lowlands formed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic
eugeosynclinal sedimentary formations. The
many islands are separated by deep trenches,
most of them fault valleys. The summits are very
jagged with numerous matterhorns and aretes
between the ice-filled cirques. Many or most of
the glaciers extend to within 500 feet of the sea
and some reach the sea. The deep, steep-walled
valleys that extend into the mountains form
spectacular fjords. During the Pleistocene, gla-
ciers from the Coast Mountains crossed the Strait
of Georgia and extended onto Vancouver Island.
  East of the Coast Mountains are interior
mountain ranges, mostly under 8,000 feet altitude,
