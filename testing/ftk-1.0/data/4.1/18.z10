reverse when they get the lender's ap-
praised-value report.
  After the real-estate bubble burst in
the late 1980s, appraisers were accused of
overstating home values. "Now they may
be going too far in the other direction,"
says Paul Havemann, president of HSH,
of Butler, N.J., a publisher of mortgage-
based financial figures. He calls it the
"equity trap."
  If you get stuck in this trap, with an
appraisal that doesn't show enough equity
in your home to cover the amount of the
loan, there are things you can do.
  Douglas Brown, president-elect of the
Appraisal Institute, an association of pro-
fessional appraisers, notes that "the law
says the lender must give you a copy of
the appraisal if you ask for it." He adds,
"Make sure that they give you the full
report, not just the government-approved
cover page." You need all the extra notes
that show what the appraiser believes are
attractions and drawbacks.
  You also want to see which recent home
sales were used as "comparables" for your
home's value estimate. "It's quite possi-
ble," Brown says, "that a nearby home
sold for a higher price after the appraiser
worked on your report."
  Or the appraiser may not be sufficiently
familiar with your neighborhood and may
have misjudged "comparables" in an adja-
cent area of lower-quality homes.
  It's also possible that a home that was
used in the comparables column was a
"distress" sale. Someone may have lost a
job, or there may have been a divorce
requiring a quick transaction.
  Armed with new facts and figures, you
should call the appraiser and ask for an
appointment to go over the report, item
by item.
  The lender may increase the equity
figure for your home so you can qualify for
the loan. If the appraiser won't budge and
you feel you have been wronged, you can
ask the lender to send out another ap-
praiser to provide a second opinion.
  You'll have to pay another appraisal fee,
but if you get the loan at the interest rate
you want, it could be worth it.     ~~
