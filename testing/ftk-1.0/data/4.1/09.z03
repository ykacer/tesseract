that five men had dragged her
from a restroom and had taken

David Cummings, Michael Cur-

Streeter -~ pleaded guilty to mis-

state law the men's guilty pleas
should be voided. Felony rape
charges were still pending in coun-
ty court, Koppell said, which
meant that the village court had
no jurisdiction in the case to ac-
cept the pleas.
