     Degrees of preparation

No single set of initials is a guarantee of competence. Still, some are
better than others:
  CFP: Certified Financial Planner. Financial planner who must meet
education, examination, experience and ethics requirements established
by the International Board of Standards and Practices for Certified
Financial Planners. IBCFP's aim is to protect the public by helping finan-
cial planners gain the credibility of other professionals, such as accoun-
tants, by making certain those who earn the CFP designation are well
qualified.
  PFS: Personal Financial Specialist. Designation the American Insti-
tute of Certified Public Accountants gives to accountants who have
passed an examination and have at least three years' experience in per-
sonal financial planning.
  CFA: Chartered Financial Analyst. Designation from the Association
for Investment Management and Research to those who have completed
a three-year program focusing on investment analysis. Many CFAs are
professional securities analysts and money managers.
  CLU: Chartered Life Underwriter. Insurance specialist trained by The
American College.
  ChFC: Chartered Financial Consultant. Insurance specialist trained
by The American College in all aspects of financial planning.  -~M.R.




charge of wire fraud-~asked in-
vestors to send their checks to her
own account at the Reserve Fund in
New York, according to Martha
Roush, her probation officer. She then
wired the money back to her bank in
Berkeley. "These people just never
knew there were no such things as
CDs backed by the Federal Reserve,"
says Roush. "Moreover, most of her
victims ignored their instincts. For
example, maybe a check was late, but
then it arrived with an explanation of
sorts and they were so glad to get it
they accepted the excuse. Others were
shocked, exclaiming, `She was so
believable; she steered me right in
times past.'"

~ Don't do business with anyone
who won't tell you exactly how
and how much he/she is paid.
  Think about whether you want to
pay for the planner's services with a
flat fee or a combination of fee and
commission. Some planners receive




only fees for their services. These
"fee-only" planners are arguably the
most objective: They will earn the
same amount of money no matter
which product you buy.
  "When you hire a fee-only planner,
he or she is a fiduciary to you and
you stand on much firmer ground if
something goes wrong," says Hoog-
stra. "When you pay a commission
you have to understand that the plan-
ner works for the people who pay the
commission and that you're purchas-
ing a product. In the eyes of the law
you're an equal. It's very much a case
of caveat emptor."
  Some planners charge a fee for
their services but offset the fee with
commissions. In other words, if your
financial-planning bill is $2,500 and
the planner earns a $500 commission
on mutual funds he sells you, you
would pay only $2,000. These are
"fee-offset" or "fee-based" planners.
Many fine planners use this system,
but it does make it a little more diffi-




cult for you to be sure you're getting
unbiased advice at a fair cost.
  The National Association of Per-
sonal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is
made up of fee-only planners. Still,
this does not necessarily mean it is
the best place to go for one. NAPFA
does not require its members to
undergo any type of testing or certi-
fication, although they must meet
some education requirements and
have at least three years of experi-
ence. Says Evensky: "I would never
use NAPFA membership as the sole
standard for competence."
  Be especially wary of stockbrokers
and insurance salespeople who call
themselves financial consultants.
They have a vested interest in selling
stocks or insurance for which they
collect a commission.
  Says AARP's Hoogstra: "You need
to say, I must know the ongoing cost
of working with you. Otherwise I'll
go elsewhere."

~ Put together a list of eight to ten
planners in your area who have
specialized training.
  You will probably want to include
someone with the CFP designation.
But that alone is not enough. Start
with these sources: your accountant,
attorney, The Institute of Certified
Financial Planners (800-282-PLAN),
the International Association for
Financial Planning (800-945-IAFP),
and the American Institute of Certi-
fied Public Accountants (800-TOA-
ICPA). Ask the latter for names in
your area of certified public accoun-
tants with the personal financial spe-
cialist (PFS) designation.
  The PFS designation is a fairly
new one; only about 700 planners
have it, says Stuart Kessler, a partner
at Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Co. in
New York City and chairman of 
AICPA's Personal Financial Planning
Executive Committee. According to
IBCFP, about 4,000 CPAs have the
CFP designation.
  Some professionals will argue that
many good planners won't be on your
