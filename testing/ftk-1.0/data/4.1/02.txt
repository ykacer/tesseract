avoid plugging the side of the hole with cement) to the level
at which the next screen is to be installed. The process is
repeated until the uppermost screen is installed, and the hole
is cemented to land surface, thus completing the piezometer
nest.




  Pressure readings, in terms of liquid head, are obtained by
connecting the piezometers through a manifold to an
inclined manometer, as shown photographically in figure 2
and schematically in figure 3. Differences in pneumatic head
between each piezometer and the atmosphere are made by
opening the manifold valve connecting that piezometer to
the manometer, all the other manifold valves being closed.
Zero manometer readings are obtained by opening the
manifold to atmosphere. The change in atmospheric
pressure during the test is measured with a microbarograph
and (or) a surveying altimeter.
  Under field conditions, a manometer inclined at a 10:1
slope and filled with fluid of specific gravity 1.20 (commer-
cial manometer fluid for outdoor use) has been found to give
readings accurate to about 0.25 mm (0.01 inch), which is
equivalent to about 30 mm (0.1 foot) of pneumatic head. A
760 mm (30-inch) manometer, having a range of 76 mm (3
inches) is adequate to measure pneumatic head differences
under most conditions. Because downhole pneumatic head
will sometimes be less than that at land surface, it is desirable
to establish, by slightly overfilling the manometer-fluid
reservoir, a reading of about 13 mm (0.5 inch) at zero




pressure difference. Thus, for a 760 mm (30-inch)
manometer, a net range of about 64 mm (2.5 inches) is
available for measuring the major head differences occurring
during the test. Such a range generally is adequate even when
unusually large atmospheric pressure changes occur.




                    DATA OBTAINED

  Data required for the method include curves or tables of
pneumatic head versus time at each depth during a period
when atmospheric pressure is changing. During the in-
vestigation, it was found to be most convenient to obtain
these data during a normal afternoon barometric decline. In
most of the areas where tests were run, such a pressure
decline usually is equivalent to 3 to 4 millibars or about 30 to
36 m of pneumatic head in 4 to 5 hours. Generally, when
determining the downhole response to diurnal barometric
changes, differences in pneumatic head between each depth
and land surface are measured in terms of liquid head at
about 15-minute intervals. Readings generally are started at
about 10 or 11 a.m., when the barometer is normally quite
stable, as such readings provide good initial conditions for
the analysis. The readings generally are continued through
the afternoon decline until 6 or 7 p.m., when a diurnal
barometric rise normally occurs.
  For electric-analog analysis, the measured pneumatic
head differences are added algebraically to the absolute
pneumatic head, as determined from a microbarograph or
an altimeter. The resultant pneumatic head values can be
plotted versus time to produce a family of curves (fig. 4), one
curve for each piezometer and one for atmospheric pressure.
