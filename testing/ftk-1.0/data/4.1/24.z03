a departmental trial on June 14.
They were suspended for 300rdays
and then placed on desk duty dur-
ing the criminal investigation.
  "Notwithstanding the fact that
we cannot find evidence which
legally corroborates the testi-
mony of Detective Young, we
find the testimony of Detective
Young to be credible and consist-
ent," the grand jury said.

  Young said he took $16,910, but
was stricken with guilt and
turned himself in to the Internal
Affairs Bureau.
  Prosecutors never found the
rest of the money, but estimated
$200,000 was stolen.

  The grand jury recommended
Young be suspended for 60 days. He
will also face a departmental trial.
  The chief government investiga-
tor, assistant district attorney Dan
Castleman, said his case was frus-
trated by the tough state law re-
garding evidence provided by ac-
complices. The law effectively
barred him from even obtaining a
search warrant to see whether Ar-
royo and Rodriguez had stacks of
cash in their possession.

  Prosecutors also wired Young
with a recording device, hoping
to catch Arroyo and Rodriguez
talking about the money on tape.
But an investigator told The
Post the cops were tipped off
about the taping in advance.
