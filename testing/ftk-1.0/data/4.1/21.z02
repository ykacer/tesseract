  Yorba Linda, Calif. -~ Mourners from
around the world left red roses, burning

wife.
  "He's our best friend because he set up
a new relationship," said Zhou Jie, a busi-

normalized relations with China, and on
Saturday China's leaders hailed the for-

  Messages from President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng praised Nixon for his
1972 breakthrough visit to Beijing that
began the rapprochement between China
and the United States, and for his efforts
to improve relations even after he re-
