Foreign chiefs, friends
praise policy successes




From Journal wire reports


  Yorba Linda, Calif. -~ Mourners from
around the world left red roses, burning
candles and cards Saturday at the Richard
Nixon Library & Birthplace in memory of
the 37th president of the United States.
  "We just feel very sad that a great man
has died," said Bryce Woodbury of Sacra-
mento, who visited the museum with his
wife.
  "He's our best friend because he set up
a new relationship," said Zhou Jie, a busi-
nessman from Chengdu, China. Nixon
normalized relations with China, and on
Saturday China's leaders hailed the for-
mer president as a man of "strategic fore-
sight and political courage."
  Messages from President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng praised Nixon for his
1972 breakthrough visit to Beijing that
began the rapprochement between China
and the United States, and for his efforts
to improve relations even after he re-
signed.
  Nixon also was well remembered in
Russia. President Boris Yeltsin said he
was "one of the first major world politi-
cians who have understood Russia and
understood what it was fighting for."
  In the United States, colleagues and
friends reacted with respect and praise.
  Former President Gerald Ford, who
succeeded Nixon and pardoned him one
month after his resignation, lauded Nix-
on's foreign-policy vision and acuity.
  "I happen to believe very strongly that
Dick Nixon was one of the finest, if not
the finest, foreign policy presidents of this
century," Ford added.
  Said former President George Bush:




"The difficulties he encountered in office
may have diminished his presidency, but
what should be remembered are his many
outstanding achievements both foreign
and domestic."
  Former President Ronald Reagan said:
"For millions, Richard Nixon was truly
one of the finest statesman this world has
ever seen."
  Former President Jimmy Carter, too,
said Nixon's "foreign policy accomplish-
ments laid important groundwork for ef-
forts of the presidents who have succeed-
ed him."
  Nixon, the nation's 37th president and
the first to resign the office, never re-
gained consciousness after suffering a
stroke Monday. He died Friday night at
age 81.
  He had left a living will that said he
wanted no extraordinary measures taken
to prolong his life.
  His body was taken to an undisclosed
funeral home where it will remain until it
is flown to Yorba Linda, Calif., his birth-
place, on Tuesday, his office said.
  Services will be held at 4 p.m. Wednes-
day PDT at the Richard Nixon Library
and Birthplace. He will be buried on the
site next to his wife, Pat, who died last
year. The Rev. Billy Graham, a longtime
Nixon friend, will officiate at the funeral.
