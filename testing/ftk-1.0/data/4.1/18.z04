items that may make your case.
  Warner advises you keep your case
argument to four minutes or so and
practice your statement and introduction
of evidence. "Judges can't stand long-
winded rambling and will cut you short,"
says Warner, who suggests sitting in on
some small-claims cases to learn from

  Warner's book contains step-by-step
instructions on how to handle your own
case. The book is available in bookstores
and libraries, or it can be ordered for
delivery by sending $19.94 to Nolo Press,
