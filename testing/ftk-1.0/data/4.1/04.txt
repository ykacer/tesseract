Unmarried couple
sues man who
won't rent to them

  TURNERS FALLS, Mass. -~
It's a bumpy ride up a mountain
road to the spotless home of Paul
and Louise Desilets.
  He is a carpet cleaner and local
landlord, devoutly Roman Cath-
olic and contemplative. She
directs Sunday school at Our
Lady of Czestochowa Church. As
a hospice visiting nurse, she com-
forts patients who choose to die
at home.
  But there are certain choices in
life that the Desilets cannot
abide.
  "Allowing fornication to occur
on property I own places my eter-
nal soul at risk," says Paul,
seated in his living room near a
two-foot statue of the Virgin
Mary.
  Instead, Desilets, 41, has put
himself at legal risk by refusing to
rent an apartment to an unmar-
ried couple.
  That would be Mark Lattanzi
and Cynthia Tarail.

Lawsuit's fifth year

  Lattanzi and Tarail's anti-dis-
crimination suit is entering its
fifth year in Massachusetts and is
sparking a national debate about
fair housing, religious freedom
and sexual mores. Twenty-four
groups -~ from Focus on the
Family to Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders -~
have filed friend-of-the-court
briefs in the matter pending
before the state supreme court.

  Lattanzi came to the Connecti-
cut River village of Turners Falls
in 1989 as a Vista worker orga-
nizing tenants to buy buildings
and convert them to cooperative
housing.

  Now, at 27, he is a local coordi-
nator for a private project against
housing discrimination.

  When Lattanzi and Tarail saw
an ad in the local daily newspa-
~ per for a $400-a-month, two-bed-
room apartment, they were inter-
ested. They had been sharing the
rent with a family of four in a
five-room apartment.




`Living in sin'

  "Then you'd be living in sin,
and we don't go for that. Don't
you know it's a criminal act to
cohabitate and fornicate?" Tarail
says she was told, or words to
that effect.
  Desilets says he never said any-
thing about living in sin, but did
say he did not want to rent to "an
unmarried cohabitating couple."
  Fornication, defined as sexual
relations between unmarried
people, is punishable by a $30
fine and as long as three months
in jail in Massachusetts, although
no one remembers the last time it
was prosecuted.
  Cohabitation was decriminal-
ized in 1987. Since 1974, it has
been against the law in Massa-
chusetts to deny housing based
on marital status.
  Lattanzi and Tarail never saw
the apartment. They ended up
moving to a $500-a-month apart-
ment and filing complaints with
the Massachusetts Commission
Against Discrimination.

Complaints credited

  In August 1990, the commis-
sion credited the complaints. A
month later, the state attorney
general filed suit on behalf of
Tarail and Lattanzi charging
Desilets and his brother, Ronald,
47, who is co-owner of the build-
ing, with violating anti-discrimi-
nation laws.
  The brothers are represented
by attorneys from the American
Center for Law and Justice, a
Virginia Beach-based law and
education group founded by
Christian broadcaster Pat Rob-
ertson in 1991. Its national net-
work of lawyers is dedicated to
"Christian advocacy and the pro-
motion of pro-liberty, pro-life
and pro-family causes."
  Arguing that sex without mar-
riage is against the dictates of his
Catholic faith, Paul Desilets says
he simply exercised his constitu-
tionally guaranteed freedom to
practice his religion when he
refused to rent to Lattanzi and
Tarail.
  In 1992, the landlords won the
