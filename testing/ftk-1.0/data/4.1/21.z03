"The difficulties he encountered in office
may have diminished his presidency, but
what should be remembered are his many
outstanding achievements both foreign
and domestic."
  Former President Ronald Reagan said:
"For millions, Richard Nixon was truly
one of the finest statesman this world has
ever seen."
  Former President Jimmy Carter, too,
said Nixon's "foreign policy accomplish-
ments laid important groundwork for ef-
forts of the presidents who have succeed-
ed him."
  Nixon, the nation's 37th president and
the first to resign the office, never re-
gained consciousness after suffering a
stroke Monday. He died Friday night at
age 81.
  He had left a living will that said he
wanted no extraordinary measures taken
to prolong his life.
  His body was taken to an undisclosed
funeral home where it will remain until it
is flown to Yorba Linda, Calif., his birth-
place, on Tuesday, his office said.
  Services will be held at 4 p.m. Wednes-
day PDT at the Richard Nixon Library
and Birthplace. He will be buried on the
site next to his wife, Pat, who died last
year. The Rev. Billy Graham, a longtime
Nixon friend, will officiate at the funeral.
