Home Warranties:
Protecting Your Investment

When you buy a previously owned home
that's getting on in years, it's hard to
know if any major system, such as the
heater or the central air conditioner,
might be on the brink of collapse. So
should you buy a one-year warranty that
covers this vital equipment and other
things, such as the plumbing, the electri-
cal system, the water heater, and the
kitchen appliances?
  "Statistics show that not much goes
wrong during the first year," says Agnes
Davis, president of American Realty
Group, in Arlington, Va., adding that it's
"sometimes better to self-insure." But she
says it might indeed be worth it if you're
buying an old house and it's hard to
determine the age and condition of the
operating systems and equipment.
  "These warranties are really for both
the buyer and the seller," says John M.
Kinker, a Lake St. Louis, Mo., home-
warranty contractor who is president of
the National Home Warranty Associa-
tion. The nonprofit trade group covers
more than 90 percent of the nation's
home-warranty contractors and is based
at its president's business headquarters.
  "The buyer gets protection against
having to pay for some major repairs,"
says Kinker, "the seller gets a good sales
tool, and, in today's litigious market, the
warranty tends to discourage lawsuits
against the real-estate agent and seller."
  Home warranties may cover not only
major systems and equipment but also
items such as trash compactors, garage-
door openers, swimming-pool equipment,
and hot tubs.
  A home-warranty service contract (it's
not insurance) costs from $350 to $450 a
year, depending on where you live and
what contractor you choose. Deductibles
range from $35 to $200 per service call.
Most real-estate agents know where con-
tracts can be purchased. For more infor-
mation, call the National Home Warranty
