Judge considers keeping
rape charges against five




The Associated Press

  CANTON, N.Y. -~ A judge has
30 days to decide whether to rein-
state rape charges against five
men who admitted having sex
with a woman after she passed out
in a restaurant.
  The victim says waiting for the
decision is no problem.
  "It's OK. I've had to do that a
lot. I'm used to it," she said Fri-
day after Acting state Supreme
Court Justice Eugene L. Nicandri
reserved decision on the case.
  After delivering 2~~~ hours of ar-
guments, attorneys said they ex-
pected Nicandri to render his de-
cision before his 30-day deadline
because of the widespread atten-
tion the case has received.
  In October 1991 the woman
was in a restaurant in Gouv-
erneur, a talc-mining center of
4,300 residents about 20 miles 




south of the U.S.-Canadian bor-
der.
  She passed out while intoxi-
cated. She learned a week later
that five men had dragged her
from a restroom and had taken
turns having sex with her.

  The men -~ Mariano Pistolesi,
David Cummings, Michael Cur-
cio, Mark Hartle and George
Streeter -~ pleaded guilty to mis-
demeanor sexual misconduct in
village court and were fined $750
each.
  New York Attorney General G.
Oliver Koppell, appointed by
Gov. Mario Cuomo as special
prosecutor in the case, said under
state law the men's guilty pleas
should be voided. Felony rape
charges were still pending in coun-
ty court, Koppell said, which
meant that the village court had
no jurisdiction in the case to ac-
cept the pleas.
