Cannibal 1: "I can't
stand my moth-
er-in-law."
 Cannibal 2: "So just eat
the vegetables."
 Mothers-in-law: they're
a favorite subject on ev-
ery comedian's joke list.
They're fair game at
bachelor parties, family
gatherings and get-to-
gethers with friends.
 She's the woman wom-
en love to hate-~a med-
dling, bossy busybody.
Or is she?
 We all have our share
of mother-in-law horror
stories. Take Phyllis She-
ras of Charlottesville,
Virginia, who had little
experience with mother-
in-law trouble until it
came knocking-~literal-
ly-~at her door.
 Phyllis can remember
smiling as she hung up
the phone. Her husband's
mother Natalie had just




told her she'd be moving
close to them and would
be able to help with the
children, the cooking and
the housekeeping.
 With Phyllis exhausted
after a busy day at work,
the news couldn't have
come at a better time. She




sank onto the sofa
and imagined how
nice it would be for
the children to have
Grandma greeting
them after school.




 Suddenly, she stiffened.
Hey, she thought to her-
self, that's not just the
kids' grandma, it's your
mother-in-law!
 Why does the thought of
an extended visit by the
women our husbands call
Mom make our blood run
cold? Well, she was his
first love. Could there be
a little rivalry brewing?
 "Two's company, three's
a crowd," says Alan En-
tin, Ph.D., past president
of the American Psycho-
logical Association's Divi-




intruder, snatching away
her son. And sensing her
mother-in-law is looking
to find fault with her, the
wife is on edge."
 The wise mother-in-law
keeps this in mind, says
Meryle Evans of New York.
She says she gets along




with her daughter-in-law
Debbie because "I don't vol-
unteer advice. I always re-
member I'm her mother-
in-law, not her mother."
 Within days of her moth-
er-in-law's arrival, Phyl-
lis was aggravated.
 She gritted her teeth as
Natalie took what seemed
like forever to make a
salad for dinner. She held
her tongue when Natalie
suggested that the kids
ought to go to bed earlier.
 She rolled her eyes when
she caught Natalie clean-




her daughter-in-law was
no bed of roses either.
 "Phyllis runs around like
a chicken with its head
cut off," she says. "She's
always busy, busy, busy.
She can't even get her
kids to sleep on time."
 Mother-in-law trouble




can turn even what
to have for dinner
into a battle.
 "The mother-in-
law doesn't want to
give up the control




she once had over her own
family," Dr. Entin says.
"The wife tries to assert
her authority, and the hus-
band makes things worse
by being namby-pamby or




fueling the fire."
 The upshot is
all too familiar:
ruined dinners,
arguing mates
and strained
family ties.
 Is there a way
to wave the white
flag-~or dishrag
-~before the sit-




"I realized things were out
of control when I found
myself stomping around
yelling, `I can't take this
anymore!'" At wit's end,
she sat her mother-in-law
down for a heart-to-heart.
 She also did some lis-
tening. "As she explained
why she did things her
way, I came to understand




Your mother-in-law




She's a meddling, bossy
busybody-~or is she?




`I found myself stomping
around yelling, "I can't
take this anymore!" '

Golden rules for
happy in-laws




It is possi-
ble to get
along, says




psychotherapist Penny Bilof-
sky, author of In-laws/Out-laws.
Here are her recommendations:
 Mothers-in-law: Don't give
unwanted advice, criticize her
housekeeping or complain to
your son about her. Give credit




generations:
times have
changed.




 Daughters-in-law: Don't ex-
pect too much or forget to say
thank you. Do mark special
days with cards and shared ac-
tivities. Brides-to-be: establish
right away what you'll call your
mom-in-law. It's difficult to form
