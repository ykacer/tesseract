`Living in sin'

  "Then you'd be living in sin,
and we don't go for that. Don't
you know it's a criminal act to
cohabitate and fornicate?" Tarail
says she was told, or words to
that effect.
  Desilets says he never said any-
thing about living in sin, but did
say he did not want to rent to "an
unmarried cohabitating couple."
  Fornication, defined as sexual
relations between unmarried
people, is punishable by a $30
fine and as long as three months
in jail in Massachusetts, although

ing, with violating anti-discrimi-
nation laws.
  The brothers are represented
by attorneys from the American
Center for Law and Justice, a
Virginia Beach-based law and
education group founded by
Christian broadcaster Pat Rob-
ertson in 1991. Its national net-
work of lawyers is dedicated to
"Christian advocacy and the pro-
motion of pro-liberty, pro-life
and pro-family causes."
  Arguing that sex without mar-
riage is against the dictates of his
Catholic faith, Paul Desilets says
he simply exercised his constitu-
tionally guaranteed freedom to
practice his religion when he
refused to rent to Lattanzi and
Tarail.
