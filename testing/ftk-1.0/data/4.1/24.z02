  A Manhattan grand jury yester-
day recommended that a police de-
tective and sergeant be fired after
they were accused of stealing
$200,000 from dead drug dealers.
  But the jurors did not have
enough evidence to indict Detec-
tive Humberto Arroyo and Sgt.
Michael Rodriguez of the 34th
Precinct, District Attorney Ro-
bert Morgenthau said.
  The two were the subject of a
20-month probe by the district
attorney's office after a fellow
cop, Detective John Young, said
he had joined the other two in
pocketing money stolen from the
scene of a double slaying of sus-
pected drug dealers in Washing-
ton Heights on Sept. 25, 1992.
  Young's testimony was the
only evidence against Rodriguez
and Arroyo, a top detective who
investigated the rape of the Cen-
tral Park jogger.
  A state law says suspects can't
be indicted if the only evidence
against them is supplied by an
accomplice.
  Young claimed that the loot,
found in the locked trunk of a car at
the murder scene, was snatched by
Arroyo and Rodriguez, who then
threatened to smear Young if he
didn't participate.
  Officials will decide whether to
punish Arroyo and Rodriguez after
