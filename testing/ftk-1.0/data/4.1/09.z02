  CANTON, N.Y. -~ A judge has
30 days to decide whether to rein-
state rape charges against five
men who admitted having sex
with a woman after she passed out
in a restaurant.
  The victim says waiting for the
decision is no problem.
  "It's OK. I've had to do that a
lot. I'm used to it," she said Fri-
day after Acting state Supreme
Court Justice Eugene L. Nicandri
reserved decision on the case.
  After delivering 2~~~ hours of ar-
guments, attorneys said they ex-
pected Nicandri to render his de-
cision before his 30-day deadline
because of the widespread atten-
tion the case has received.
  In October 1991 the woman
was in a restaurant in Gouv-
erneur, a talc-mining center of
4,300 residents about 20 miles
