                    DATA OBTAINED

  Data required for the method include curves or tables of
pneumatic head versus time at each depth during a period
when atmospheric pressure is changing. During the in-
vestigation, it was found to be most convenient to obtain
these data during a normal afternoon barometric decline. In
most of the areas where tests were run, such a pressure
decline usually is equivalent to 3 to 4 millibars or about 30 to
36 m of pneumatic head in 4 to 5 hours. Generally, when
determining the downhole response to diurnal barometric
changes, differences in pneumatic head between each depth
and land surface are measured in terms of liquid head at
about 15-minute intervals. Readings generally are started at
about 10 or 11 a.m., when the barometer is normally quite
stable, as such readings provide good initial conditions for
the analysis. The readings generally are continued through
the afternoon decline until 6 or 7 p.m., when a diurnal
barometric rise normally occurs.
  For electric-analog analysis, the measured pneumatic
head differences are added algebraically to the absolute
pneumatic head, as determined from a microbarograph or
an altimeter. The resultant pneumatic head values can be
plotted versus time to produce a family of curves (fig. 4), one
curve for each piezometer and one for atmospheric pressure.
