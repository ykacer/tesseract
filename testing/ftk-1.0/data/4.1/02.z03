  Pressure readings, in terms of liquid head, are obtained by
connecting the piezometers through a manifold to an
inclined manometer, as shown photographically in figure 2
and schematically in figure 3. Differences in pneumatic head
between each piezometer and the atmosphere are made by
opening the manifold valve connecting that piezometer to
the manometer, all the other manifold valves being closed.
Zero manometer readings are obtained by opening the
manifold to atmosphere. The change in atmospheric
pressure during the test is measured with a microbarograph
and (or) a surveying altimeter.
  Under field conditions, a manometer inclined at a 10:1
slope and filled with fluid of specific gravity 1.20 (commer-
cial manometer fluid for outdoor use) has been found to give
readings accurate to about 0.25 mm (0.01 inch), which is
equivalent to about 30 mm (0.1 foot) of pneumatic head. A
760 mm (30-inch) manometer, having a range of 76 mm (3
inches) is adequate to measure pneumatic head differences
under most conditions. Because downhole pneumatic head
will sometimes be less than that at land surface, it is desirable
to establish, by slightly overfilling the manometer-fluid
reservoir, a reading of about 13 mm (0.5 inch) at zero
