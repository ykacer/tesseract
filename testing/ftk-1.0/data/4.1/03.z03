and mostly formed of folded Mesozoic eugeo-
synclinal formations. Associated with these
ranges are extensive plateaus capped by lavas.
The most extensive of these extends the southern
half of British Columbia covering about 15,000
square miles along each side at an altitude of
about 3,000 to 4,000 feet. It covers much of the
south half of British Columbia. The lava-capped
plateau, at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, has
three large shield volcanoes near the middle of
the west side. The lavas are Tertiary to Holocene
in age. They overlie folded and faulted eugeo-
synclinal sedimentary formations, including
Paleozoic rocks on the east and Mesozoic on the
west. The canyon of the Frazer River is incised
into the plateau and reaches the Strait of Georgia
in a valley that curves around the south end of
the Coast Mountains (Fig. 18.29).
  Uplift of the Coast Mountains began in Juras-
sic time, and during the Cretaceous Period this
was part of a mountainous area west of the geo-
synclinal sea that connected the Gulf of Mexico
and the Artic Ocean (Fig. 2.14,C; p. 378). Struc-
tural deformation and igneous activity have con-
tinued to the present time. One volcano, Mount
