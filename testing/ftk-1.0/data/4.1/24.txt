Jury: Fire cops
who looted 200G




      By MIKE PEARL
  and LARRY CELONA

  A Manhattan grand jury yester-
day recommended that a police de-
tective and sergeant be fired after
they were accused of stealing
$200,000 from dead drug dealers.
  But the jurors did not have
enough evidence to indict Detec-
tive Humberto Arroyo and Sgt.
Michael Rodriguez of the 34th
Precinct, District Attorney Ro-
bert Morgenthau said.
  The two were the subject of a
20-month probe by the district
attorney's office after a fellow
cop, Detective John Young, said
he had joined the other two in
pocketing money stolen from the
scene of a double slaying of sus-
pected drug dealers in Washing-
ton Heights on Sept. 25, 1992.
  Young's testimony was the
only evidence against Rodriguez
and Arroyo, a top detective who
investigated the rape of the Cen-
tral Park jogger.
  A state law says suspects can't
be indicted if the only evidence
against them is supplied by an
accomplice.
  Young claimed that the loot,
found in the locked trunk of a car at
the murder scene, was snatched by
Arroyo and Rodriguez, who then
threatened to smear Young if he
didn't participate.
  Officials will decide whether to
punish Arroyo and Rodriguez after




a departmental trial on June 14.
They were suspended for 300rdays
and then placed on desk duty dur-
ing the criminal investigation.
  "Notwithstanding the fact that
we cannot find evidence which
legally corroborates the testi-
mony of Detective Young, we
find the testimony of Detective
Young to be credible and consist-
ent," the grand jury said.

  Young said he took $16,910, but
was stricken with guilt and
turned himself in to the Internal
Affairs Bureau.
  Prosecutors never found the
rest of the money, but estimated
$200,000 was stolen.

  The grand jury recommended
Young be suspended for 60 days. He
will also face a departmental trial.
  The chief government investiga-
tor, assistant district attorney Dan
Castleman, said his case was frus-
trated by the tough state law re-
garding evidence provided by ac-
complices. The law effectively
barred him from even obtaining a
search warrant to see whether Ar-
royo and Rodriguez had stacks of
cash in their possession.

  Prosecutors also wired Young
with a recording device, hoping
to catch Arroyo and Rodriguez
talking about the money on tape.
But an investigator told The
Post the cops were tipped off
about the taping in advance.
