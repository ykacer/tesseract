			THE WALL CALENDAR

gift for anyone -- from teenagers to grandparents! Its large 11-by-14-
inch size beautifully displays 12 expansive photographs -- big enough to
frame when the year is over! Jot down appointments and notes in the
generous squares for each day of the month, Sunday through Saturday.
There's an extra page for January 1995 notations.

			CHILDREN'S WALL CALENDAR
		...a fun-filled 1994 calendar for kids.

	Youngsters will love WATER WATCH!, their very own wall calendar,
as National Geographic transports them to freshwater habitats where
animals make their homes. Kids are fascinated by big, bright pictures
of a cow moose lunching on water plants in a northern lake...a sockeye
salmon leaping straight for the inevitable -- an Alaskan bear's open
mouth...a beautiful aquatic bird (the purple gallinule) high-stepping
across lily pads in a marsh.

	They'll have a lot of fun tracing the course of a river that
meanders through each 11-by-14-inch calendar page. Whimsical
illustrations of animals living in and near the water amuse and delight.
Cartoon figures give the dos and don'ts of being a water-watcher. And,
in an entertaining and delightful way, the message of water conservation
is easily understood.

		And the calendars are all so affordable!

	Value-priced at only $8.95 each, (plus postage and handling),
these 1994 calendars cost even less when you order two or more! Mix
styles to suit your gift list. See the enclosed Reservation Card to
