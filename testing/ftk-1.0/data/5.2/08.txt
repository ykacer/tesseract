radioactive waste has been shipped to Beatty. Because of
no enforcement of proper packaging of radioactive waste
by shippers and continual reports of leaking packaging,
efforts to close the Beatty dump site have been going on
for the past few years. After all the powers that be
agreed to close this dump site, we now must wait a couple
more years until Colorado builds its own dump site, and
then we can close ours. Simultaneously research proposals
to study the long-term effects of low-level radioactive
exposure on the health of the population of Nevada have
been submitted the past few years, and all have been
rejected for funding. At present we have no knowledge
what the effects of low-level radiation exposure may have
upon us. I've just mentioned two instances of national
and statewide unconcern for the public's health because
it raises some serious questions regarding a high-level
radioactive dump site in Nevada. And frankly, the term
"repository" is a euphemism I resent. It's a dump site.
   The first question I am posing to you has
to do with the protection of the people of Nevada. Since
the American public is a bit disillusioned with the honesty
