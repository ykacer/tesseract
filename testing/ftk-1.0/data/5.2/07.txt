3.6 Regional Hydrologic Reconnaissance of Candidate Area and Site
Describe the regional hydrogeologic framework and regional ground-water
flow systems and their boundaries.*
3.6.1 Hydrogeologic Units
Present a hydrogeologic column of the region in a form as detailed as the
information allows. Include the principal hydrogeologic units (includes both
confining units and aquifers), their stratigraphic relationships, lithology,
generalized potentiometric levels for a given time and location, and hydrologic
characteristics. The terminology should be consistent with the terminology
used in the regional stratigraphic column presented in Section 1.2. A hydro-
geologic map of the candidate area should be presented indicating areal extent
of the regional hydrogeologic units and unit interfaces and data points.**
Cross sections should be provided where appropriate.
3.6.2 Relationships Among Hydrogeologic Units
Describe the relationships among the regional hydrogeologic units. The
principal relationships sought are potentiometric levels, recharge-discharge
and leakage, hydrochemical facies, hydrologic interconnection between units
(fractures, faults, etc.) and ground-water residence times. References should
be made to the hydrogeologic map and to the cross sections presented in
Section 3.6.1.
3.6.3 Potentiometric Level
Define the time history and areal distribution of measured potentiometric
levels of each principal hydrogeologic unit. The method of presenting the
data can include hydrographs, potentiometric contour maps, and graphs to
identify the characteristic fluctuations resulting from the various types of
recharge-discharge (i.e., seasonal precipitation and evaporation fluctuations,
seasonal pumping variations, seasonal response to surface-water bodies, etc.).
Potentiometric surface maps should include such information as the location of
the monitoring wells, hydrogeologic unit boundaries, surface-water bodies, and
specific well information (i.e., perforation interval and elevations, total
depth history, casing, method of well completion, etc.).
3.6.4 Hydraulic Characteristics of Principal Hydrogeologic Units
For each of the principal hydrogeologic units, provide the ranges, mean
values, and methods for determining the principal hydraulic characteristics
such as horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity, storage coefficient,
effective porosity, and saturated thickness. Also include a discussion of the
appropriateness of assuming Darcian flow conditions in the various hydrogeologic
units.


*Definitions of ground-water terminology used in this chapter are consistent
with U.S. Geological Survey Water Supply Paper No. 1988, "Definitions of
Selected Ground-Water Terms - Revisions and Conceptual Refinements" (1972).
**Use, where practicable, internationally recognized map symbols (UNESCO,
International Legend for Hydrologic Maps, Paris, France, 1970).
