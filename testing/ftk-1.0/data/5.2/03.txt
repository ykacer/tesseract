Earthquake Occurring During Emplacement Operations

  This combination of events may impose significant loads on the
interface between the transporter cask and the emplacement borehole. This
loading will be independent of other factors such as borehole filling,
radiation, and temperature. To accomodate the load, it will be necessary to
design the interface with strength sufficient to withstand the imposed
loads. It will also be necessary to design the transporter with reaction
supports adequate to ensure that the waste transporter moves in harmony with
the ground motion. In addition, the E/R system will be designed so that any
adverse effects resulting from ground movement during emplacement or
retrieval can be rapidly mitigated.

Water Intrusion into a Filled Borehole

  It is currently planned that waste will not be emplaced in boreholes
where water inflow is detected. Water inflow after emplacement could
possibly occur, however, if a perched reservoir is replenished by
precipitation and subsequently recreates a dripping fracture that intersects
the emplacement borehole. If such a combination of circumstances occurs, it
will present no significant hazard during retrieval because the water will
be vaporized as it encounters the boiling temperature isotherm around the
borehole and will subsequently be driven into the rock or down the annulus
between the liner and the borehole wall until it cools and condenses. This
does not alter the design basis for the liner environment because the design
basis already includes the presence of water vapor.

Conclusion

  Two points should be made regarding this discussion. The first is that
this discussion is not intended to lend credibility to the synergistic
scenarios presented. The second point is that the synergistic effects are
not unique to horizontal emplacement; they are also present for vertical
emplacement and must be considered in design for either emplacement
configuration.

  In summary, it is concluded that no significant adverse conditions will
develop with the horizontal emplacement configuration due to synergistic
effects.
