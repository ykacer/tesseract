  The cement storage tank, fabricated from mild steel, has a capacity of 28 m3 (1000 ft3); it
is 4.4 m (14.5 ft) tall and requires 14 m2 (150 ft2) of floor space. The tank fluidizes the
cement in an air stream and includes a rotary undercut type of shutoff and flow rate regulatory
valve at the outlet. Air for fluidizing the cement is furnished by a 5-hp cast-iron positive
displacement rotary blower equipped with a pressure relief valve with intake and exhaust air
silencers. A bucket elevator lifts cement from the storage tank into a small (about 2 to 3 m3)
feed tank that discharges into the drum feed screw conveyor.

  The drum loading system consists of a drum conveyor, a control cabinet, and a fixed-height
fill nozzle surrounded by a dust control plenum. The drum loading system control cabinet is
equipped with an elevating mechanism to lift the drum into the load position and an electronic
scale to weigh the amount of cement added.

  Waste Feed System. The waste feed system is a compact assembly of components designed
to remotely decant waste slurries and to pump slurries and concentrated waste solutions to the
drums for immobilization. The equipment is mounted on both sides of a machined-steel shield
wall approximately 1.5 ~ 3 ~ 0.3 m (5 ~ 10 ~ 1 ft) thick for personnel protection during
operation and maintenance. The shielding wall bolts to machined inserts in the concrete shield
walls of the radioactive waste processing area.

  The waste feed system contains the decanting tank, decanting pump, slurry metering pump,
concentrated waste metering pump and associated controls and piping mounted on a shield wall.
The stainless steel decanting tank is 1.4 m (4.5 ft) in diameter by 1.5 m (5 ft) tall. It has
a working capacity of 1.9 m3 (500 gal). It includes a moveable decanting nozzle, sensors, and
a mechanical mixer. An emergency overflow at the top of the tank connects to the plant drain
line. The decant tank is vented to the radioactive process vent treatment system. A water
spray manifold at the top of the tank provides for internal decontamination for maintenance
operations. The motors and actuators are located on the "cold" side of the shield wall.

  Dry, particulate wastes require special handling to introduce them into the FRP CIF.
Two options appear feasible. For dense solids, a dry weighing system similar to the cement
filling station could be used. Light solids, such as incinerator ashes, could be pneumatically
transferred to the decant tank or a special mixing station where they would be blended with
water or a suitable waste solution. Both systems are conceptual and require specific engineer-
ing design.

  Drumming Station. The drumming station is designed to immobilize radioactive slurries
and solutions in cement in 55-gal drums. It is mounted on both sides of a machined-steel
shield wall approximately 1.5 ~ 3 ~ 0.3 m (5 ~ 10 ~ 1 ft) thick. All motors and as much
support equipment as practical are mounted on the cold side of the wall. The shield wall bolts
to machined steel inserts that fit into the concrete shield walls of the radioactive waste pro-
cessing areas.
