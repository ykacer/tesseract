more arid than the usual pinyon-juniper climate, but more temperate

than now.

Above 5,000 feet (1,524 m) the vegetation mosaic is characteristic of
the Great Basin Desert and is dominated by sagebrush associations of
Artemisia tridentata and Artemisia arbuscula ssp. nova (Fig. 12). The
Distribution of Great Basin associations appears to be limited by mean
maximum temperature and minimum rainfall tolerances of these "cold"
58
desert species.  Pinyon pine, Pinus monophylla, and juniper, Juniperus
osteosperma, are the usual dominants at elevations above 6,000 feet
(1,829 m) and mix with the sagebrush associations on mountains and
mesas of the northern and western protions of the Nevada Test Site
58
where there is suitable moisture for these trees (Fig. 13).

Adjacent to the playas in the closed basins of Frenchman and Yucca
flats are associations dominated by either shadscale, Atriplex conferti-
folia; four-winged saltbush, Atriplex canescens; Lycium pallidum-Grayia;
or Lycium shockleyi. The associations containing species of Lycium
appear to be primarily controlled by low temperatures in these cold air
drainages, but they are also related to the composition of the bedrock
58  317
from which the soils were derived and to salinity. Atriplex vegetation
types are correlated with highly calcareous soils and appear to be ex-
ceptional in that edaphic controls are probably more important than
58
climatic conditions in limiting their distribution.

Shrub coverage within the Mohave Desert types averages about 16% with
a range of 7% to 23%. Transitional vegetation types average 29% with a
range of 12% to 50%, while shrub coverage in Great Basin types averages
24% with a range of 15% to 37%. Shrub coverage within the various vege-
57
tation types is highly correlated with mean annual rainfall.  Standing
crop of shrubs in Rock Valley is approximately 3,100 kg/hectare. Roots

contribute about 45% by weight to the total.

Winter annual forbs and grasses are the dominant species of ground cover,
and they contribute most to the annual production of biomass. However,
