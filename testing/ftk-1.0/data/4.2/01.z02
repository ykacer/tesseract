be weaned at any time, but we recom-
mend breast-feeding through as much of
the infant's first year as possible.

Q. How often should a newborn be fed?
A. Feeding a newborn is a compromise
between on demand and what's possible
for the mother. On average, babies are
fed every two to three hours.

Q. My ten-year-old daughter's appetite
has recently jumped up considerably.
Suddenly she's asking for second help-
ings and nibbling after school. Why this
change?
A. The average ten-year-old girl is about
to go through a phenomenal growth
spurt. Your daughter is eating more be-
cause girls grow rapidly as their hormones
shift toward adolescence and the onset of
menstruation and puberty begins.

Q. My friend makes all her own baby
food. Is her child better nourished as a
result?
A. No. Commercially prepared baby
food is a perfectly acceptable choice for
parents to make.

Q. How important is fruit in a child's
diet?
A. Fruit has vitamins, minerals, fiber,
and can supply a child with energy. You

but fruit is tasty and low-fat, too.

Q. Obesity runs in my husband's fam-

appetite. How can I limit his diet with-
out turning into a nag?
A. If he is growing consistently and his
weight is not far out of line for his

However, if your pediatrician tells you
that your child is quite heavy for his
height, you may want to think about
lower-calorie alternatives to some of his
favorite foods. But don't nag and don't
worry. Emphasize the value of exercise
and try to provide the right balance of
foods.

Q. During busy workweeks, making
meals is difficult. My children love fast-
food dinners, but I worry about relying
on "junk." How bad is a steady take-out-
diet?
A. There is nothing wrong with take-out
food as long as you don't order the same
thing all the time. Pizza and hamburgers,
in particular, can have lots of fat and
salt. So order pizza one night, then
turkey or broiled chicken sandwiches the
next, and after that hamburgers or pizza
(without the extra cheese, pepperoni, or

meals with a salad and offer plenty of
fruit.

Q. Is it true that eating rice or drinking
the water in which rice has been cooked
will help a child recover from diarrhea?
