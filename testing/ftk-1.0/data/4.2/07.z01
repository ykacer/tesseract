moles of components in the inflowing test
water or groundwater are added to the inven-
tory of available material.

In some experimental designs sampling is done
at scheduled intervals. An option is there-
fore provided in the model for the exchange
of specified fractions of the resident water
volume on a schedule listed in the input in-
struction file. The exchange intervals are,
however, independent of the step timer, so
that the progress of reactions may be studied
between exchanges.

  7.1.6.1 Thermodynamics of Surface
	  Products

The solid materials for which published sta-
bility data are available in the data bases
of PROTOCOL and other general-purpose chemi-
cal codes are mostly crystalline phases with
well-defined stoichiometries and Gibbs free
energies of formation. In the leaching of
minerals and glasses at low temperatures,
however, both crystalline and amorphous solid
products may be formed at the interface, and
both may be variable in composition. Al-
though the amorphous materials are thought to
be metastable solid solutions, they can per-
sist for long periods of time and appear to
interact reversibly with dissolved species.
The fact that these apparently metastable
equilibrium aqueous concentrations can be
attained after extended leaching under static
or low flow conditions implies the existence
of solubility controls on dissolution or re-
lease. This is of sufficient importance
that, in addition to a constant aqueous com-
position, it is also desirable to secure con-
firmatory thermochemical evidence of the sta-
bility of the system. This requires the
determination of thermochemical properties of
the surface material and their incorporation
into the PROTOCOL data base.

In certain simple cases, as in the well-known
reactions of the metastable phases of silica,
steady states can be treated thermodynam-
ically and the activities of dissolved spe-
cies reflect the structures of the solids in
a predictable way. It is likely that the
analysis of reactions forming more complex
metastable phases can also be undertaken by
thermodynamically-based models, provided that
the energies of the bonds that are formed are
characteristic of the solid being leached and
the temperature, and that the product phases
do not undergo further alteration at signifi-
cant rates.
