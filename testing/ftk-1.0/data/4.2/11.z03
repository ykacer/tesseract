"I don't usually walk my dog, but that day I felt like getting outside,"
says John Dow (right) of Vienna, Virginia. He's recalling the day last
fall when he walked into the path of an emergency. His neighbor, in
the background here, was on a riding mower. It hit a tree and flipped
over, pinning her underneath. "I heard her call, `Help!'" says John, 10.
"I wasn't scared. I ran over and lifted the mower about 8 inches off the 
ground"-~high enough for the woman to roll to safety. How did a 72-
pound boy lift a 400-pound mower? John's not sure. For bravery
beyond his years, John was named Vienna Citizen of the Year.
