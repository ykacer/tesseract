moles of components in the inflowing test
water or groundwater are added to the inven-
tory of available material.

In some experimental designs sampling is done
at scheduled intervals. An option is there-
fore provided in the model for the exchange
of specified fractions of the resident water
volume on a schedule listed in the input in-
struction file. The exchange intervals are,
however, independent of the step timer, so
that the progress of reactions may be studied
between exchanges.

  7.1.6.1 Thermodynamics of Surface
	  Products

The solid materials for which published sta-
bility data are available in the data bases
of PROTOCOL and other general-purpose chemi-
cal codes are mostly crystalline phases with
well-defined stoichiometries and Gibbs free
energies of formation. In the leaching of
minerals and glasses at low temperatures,
however, both crystalline and amorphous solid
products may be formed at the interface, and
both may be variable in composition. Al-
though the amorphous materials are thought to
be metastable solid solutions, they can per-
sist for long periods of time and appear to
interact reversibly with dissolved species.
The fact that these apparently metastable
equilibrium aqueous concentrations can be
attained after extended leaching under static
or low flow conditions implies the existence
of solubility controls on dissolution or re-
lease. This is of sufficient importance
that, in addition to a constant aqueous com-
position, it is also desirable to secure con-
firmatory thermochemical evidence of the sta-
bility of the system. This requires the
determination of thermochemical properties of
the surface material and their incorporation
into the PROTOCOL data base.

In certain simple cases, as in the well-known
reactions of the metastable phases of silica,
steady states can be treated thermodynam-
ically and the activities of dissolved spe-
cies reflect the structures of the solids in
a predictable way. It is likely that the
analysis of reactions forming more complex
metastable phases can also be undertaken by
thermodynamically-based models, provided that
the energies of the bonds that are formed are
characteristic of the solid being leached and
the temperature, and that the product phases
do not undergo further alteration at signifi-
cant rates.




One approach to the chemical modeling of a
disordered phase is to treat it numerically
as a mixture of discrete component phases,
with individual stabilities. The advantage
of this procedure is that each such component
phase can be treated in simulation as a dis-
solved solid with a stability that can be re-
lated to an equilibrium aqueous composition.

The methodology of Tardy and Garrels (1974)
is a well-known procedure for the estimation
of the stabilities of layer silicates that
may be applicable to the less ordered prod-
ucts of glass dissolution. They showed that
for the layer silicate structure, the compo-
nent oxides make constant contributions to
the total free energy of the phase. It was
possible to make estimates of their stabil-
ities that were consistent not only with
those of composite phases, but with solubil-
ity data, i.e., the activities of dissolved
species in equilibrated leachates. The free
energies of formation of simple oxides as
"silicated" components that were determined
in this way are in many cases very different
from their standard state values, reflecting
their degree of bonding. Once determined,
however, they could simply be added and sub-
tracted to construct other complex phases of
similar structures but different stoichio-
metries and previously unknown stabilities.

The concept can be extended to the alteration
products of specific glass compositions at
constant temperature if there is sufficient
regularity in the structures that are formed.

In the present application, we do not exactly
duplicate the Tardy-Garrels approach, since
there is not a comparable set of alteration
product phases known to be of similar struc-
ture and with known thermochemical proper-
ties. For our purposes, this set must
be generated from the reference glass
composition.

The most direct approach is to measure ex-
perimentally the concentrations of dissolved
species. As they approach steady state, the
free energies of reaction computed from the
activity products also become constant. If
the solid composition is also known, the
overall reaction can be written, and the
value of the composite solid phase free
energy computed. It may also be possible
to estimate the stabilities for silicated
components that are otherwise difficult to
determine by constructing plots of free
energy of silication versus element
electronegativity.
