us assume that lengths l1, l2~~~ln are all superior to h. The estimation
variance is obtained by weighting the extension variance of each drift within
its influence panel by the square of the surface of this panel:




  The explored mineralized surface being S = h(l1 + l2 ~~~ + ln) and the
total developed length being L = l1 + l2 + ~~~ ln, we obtain the following
remarkable formula:




  Once the estimation variance has been calculated, one has still to in-
terpret it for practical uses under the form of conventional error spread.
This aim is reached by allocating to this variance a probabilistic meaning.
By implicit reference to a gaussian model, we shall take it that the actual
average grade of the deposit is included within a 95% probability in the
range m ~~ 2~, m being the estimated grade. In other cases, particularly if
2~ is not small towards m, we shall take the spread m exp (~~2~/m), by
reference to a lognormal model.
  These implicit references to probabilistic models are mainly arbitrary.
Actually, the notion itself of statistical distribution of an estimation error
is doubtlessly meaningless. The only thing which has an objective physical
meaning is the variance. This is why we speak about conventional spreads.
Their practical interest resides in the fact that they draw a more intuitive
picture of the possible errors than variances themselves.

		KRIGING

  A second application of major importance is provided by a geostatistical
procedure called "kriging." It consists in estimating the grade of a panel by
computing the weighted average of available samples, some being located
inside others outside the panel. The grads of these samples being x1,
x2, ~~~ xn, we attempt to evaluate the unknown grade ~ of the panel with
a linear estimator ~~ of the form:




  The suitable weights ai assigned to each sample are determined by two
conditions. The first one expresses that ~* and ~ must have the same aver-
age value within the whole large field ~~ and is written as:




  The second condition expresses that the ai have such values that estima-
tion variance of ~ by ~`, in other words the kriging variance, should take the
smallest possible value.
