where C(~~,t) is radionuclide concentration at position ~~ and time t, R is
retardation coefficient, ~ is porosity, ~ is water saturation, D is dif-

fusivity, h is half-life and ~~ is water velocity. Equation (14) is solved
numerically, e.g., via a finite difference method. Then Eq. (14) is ap-
proximated by
