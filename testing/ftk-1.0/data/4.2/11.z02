If you think chess is slow and boring, then you've never seen the
Raging Rooks play it. "I try to win most of my tournament
games in ten minutes," says Anthony Grier (above, fourth from
left). "I figure out my opponent's plan, stop it, and attack."
  Members of the Rooks-~students at Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.
Junior High School 43 in New York, New York-~practice almost
every day before school and during lunch. Most study chess
books and play at home every night. "When I do well in chess, I 
do well in other things, too," says team captain Edwin Moran, 14,
second from left. With Edwin are some of the other Rooks: from
the left, Tarquin Sarkany, 15; Reuben Thomas, 15; Anthony, 14;
Danny Collins, 15; faculty advisor Richard Gudonsky, who works
with them several times a week; and Edward Velazquez, 15.
  The Raging Rooks won the last two New York State Scholastic
Championships in their division. They have also tied for first in
the National Junior High School Chess Championships.
