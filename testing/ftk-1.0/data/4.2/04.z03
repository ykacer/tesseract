where ~~ is a vector of concentrations at nodes {xi}, A is a matrix which

depends on ~~, R, ~, ~ and D and on the discretization. The term B~~ incor-
porates boundary conditions and sinks/sources. Equation (15) is called a
state-space equation. If Eq. (15) is discretized in time, a state transi-
tion equation obtains
