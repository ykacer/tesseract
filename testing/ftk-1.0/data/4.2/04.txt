where C(~~,t) is radionuclide concentration at position ~~ and time t, R is
retardation coefficient, ~ is porosity, ~ is water saturation, D is dif-

fusivity, h is half-life and ~~ is water velocity. Equation (14) is solved
numerically, e.g., via a finite difference method. Then Eq. (14) is ap-
proximated by




where ~~ is a vector of concentrations at nodes {xi}, A is a matrix which

depends on ~~, R, ~, ~ and D and on the discretization. The term B~~ incor-
porates boundary conditions and sinks/sources. Equation (15) is called a
state-space equation. If Eq. (15) is discretized in time, a state transi-
tion equation obtains




This analysis assumes that A and ~~ are constant over ~t (perfect temporal
correlation); this analysis is only concerned with spatial heterogeneity.
   Expanding Eq. (16) in Taylor series and taking the expected value leads 
to the relation for the mean value (see Dettinger and Wilson, 1981)




where the subscript "o" indicates evaluated at mean value. Equation (17) is 
the first-order estimate of the mean and has the same form as Eq. (16). The
second-order estimate has additional terms.
   The covariance is given by applying Eq. (13) to get




Any single term in Cov(~~(t)) is
