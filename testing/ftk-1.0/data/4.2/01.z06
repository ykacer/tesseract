THE AMERICAN ACADEMY
OF PEDIATRICS
The American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) is an organization
of 45,000 pediatricians dedicated
to the health, safety, and well-
being of infants, children,
adolescents, and young adults.
The organization's members,
through special committees and
sections, study and influence
important child-care concerns
affecting today's families. These
issues include day care, access to
medical care, immunizations, and
injury prevention. The AAP holds
several medical meetings during
the year and publishes the journal
Pediatrics.
