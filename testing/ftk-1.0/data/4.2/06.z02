models that will be the means by which these data pass from site character-
ization investigations to design and performance assessment studies. Because
the rock characteristics data and the geologic framework information both
will be represented as three-dimensional computer-based models that are
closely linked to the NNWSI Project Technical Data Base, representations of
the model may take many forms depending upon the use to which the information
will be put. For example, information from the model may be represented on
contour (isopleth) maps, cross sections, level plans, "3-D" perspective
illustrations, statistical distributions (histograms, means, variances), and
as numerical data files for direct input to computer codes used for perform-
ance assessment or design analyses. The primary requirement of input data
for the three-dimensional rock property models is systematic and statis-
tically valid (unbiased) sampling at scales adequate to allow quantitative
characterization of the spatial variability of the parameters of interest at
Yucca Mountain. Characterization of spatial variability will depend heavily
upon geostatistical techniques. Determination of sampling intervals and
parameters will rely upon geostatistical analysis in conjunction with
sensitivity studies conducted by the associated performance assessment or
design information needs.

  Much of the analysis of the spatial variability will depend upon
detailed knowledge of a few selected rock characteristics (e.g., porosity,
saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturation) that will be obtained as part
of the integrated drilling program described by Investigation 8.3.1.4.1.
These parameters will serve as surrogates in determining the spatial
variability of several other parameters needed by performance assessment and
design issues in preliminary stages of the analyses. Because the basic
spatial distribution of properties of the rock mass at Yucca Mountain is that
produced by the processes of volcanic eruption, transport, deposition, and
post-depositional alteration (including welding and devitrification), the
quantitative description of the distribution should correspond to parameters
that derive their distribution from some part of those emplacement and
alteration processes.

  The measured values of parameters from which the final modeling
activities will be conducted, will come largely from Site Programs 8.3.1.2
(geohydrology), 8.3.1.3 (geochemistry), and 8.3.1.15 (thermal and mechanical
properties).

  The models typically will be constructed as follows. First, measured
values of the hydrogeologic, geochemical, or thermal/mechanical parameters of
interest (from drillholes and the exploratory shaft facilities) will be
mapped into their proper three-dimensional location in model space. Second,
geologic framework information (the altitude of geologic contacts, fault
locations and offsets, etc.), from Investigation 8.3.1.4.2 also will be
mapped into three-dimensional model space. The spatial structure of the
observed values (actual measurements) will be determined by geostatistical
techniques (variogram or covariance analysis). The spatial structure of a
group of related parameters may be further refined by study of the cross-
covariances among those quantities. Conflicts between the observed spatial
structure of quantitative data and the structure implied by the geologic
framework will be resolved (for example, identification of a concealed fault,
reinterpretation of volcanic source area or flow path, or identification of
some previously unknown alteration phenomenon). Surface-based and borehole
