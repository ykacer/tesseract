1. Realistic temperature dependent nonlinear material properties have been
   incorporated in the program and the solution at each point in time is
   obtained by iteration.

2. Each element has a "birth" and "death" time. Therefore, stresses at
   different stages of excavation or construction can be obtained.

3. The substructure (or super element) option allows areas of the mesh
   representing the surrounding rock mass that are far removed from the
   high stress regions to be modeled by elastic substructures in which
   all the unknowns are eliminated within these substructures. As a
   result, only a limited number of elements are required in the iterative
   nonlinear analysis (See Figure 8).

4. Geometric constraints have been added to the program which allow coarse and
   fine meshes to be merged without the use of triangular elements. Therefore,
   a consistently higher level of accuracy is obtained ~see Figure 8A~.

   Prior to the termination of this study, work had begun on the development of
a three-dimensional element (4 to 27 nodes) with temperature dependent, nonlinear
properties. This effort is about half completed, and work was also initiated on
the development of a general three-dimensional mesh generation program for
underground structures with openings of arbitrary geometric shape.

   It has been demonstrated that USAP is not only an effective program for
the correlation studies associated with the Stripa project, but has the potential
to be used effectively in far more general problems associated with the under-
ground storage of nuclear waste. The options of temperature-dependent nonlinear
