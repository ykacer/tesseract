BREEDING IN YOUR HOME

Use an insect growth regulator. Look for
products containing either methoprene or
fenoxycarb, sold as do-it-yourself sprays.
Used properly, they're risk-free for you
and your animals but death to flea eggs
and larvae. "Foggers" with these growth
regulators are also good but tricky to use.
They mostly spread tiny droplets that fall
straight down and won't drift under sofas
or around corners. No matter what you
use, wash the pet on the same day.
Vacuum, vacuum, vacuum. You'll not only
suck up lots of flea eggs, you'll starve any
lingering larvae. Use the powered, rotat-
ing "beater brush" attachment on your
vacuum. Then take that pointy crevice
tool and get tough with the couch and
baseboards. Repeat early and often.
Wash your pet's bedding once a week with
detergent. Dry on high heat. Flea pupae
die at temperatures above 95~F and at
humidities below 50 percent. If your pet
doesn't have bedding, give him some.
You could even put a towel down in the
car or under a favorite napping bush.
Consider flea-killing dusts. If you can stand
the mess, diatomaceous earth supposedly
dehydrates fleas and their larvae when you
sprinkle it on your pet's bedding. It's hard
to find, though (check pet shops), and all
flea experts aren't convinced it helps.
  Borate powder (a.k.a. boric acid or borax)
is tougher on fleas, but you have to spread
the stuff on your furniture and carpets and
then make a point of not cleaning it up.
