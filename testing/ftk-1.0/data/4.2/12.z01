fleas. On this day, all 7,500 of them are
happily standing upside down biting
through a plastic membrane to suck up
the cow's blood on the other side. One
Artificial Dog produces 12,000 fleas a
day, doing work that formerly employed
about 25 real dogs and cats.
  This morning, Georgi is gathering eggs.
He does it by removing the pens from the
dog, then opening each one over a funnel-
shaped "flea separator." The adult fleas
hop out and fall into the funnel, where the
vacuum's suction pins them against a
screen "in a high wind," as Georgi puts it.
The eggs stay behind.
  I comment on how this miracle system
lets no fleas escape when, sure enough,
one gets away. We both dive to the floor to
grab him, but the flea fakes left and goes
right, then right again and disappears.
  "If you don't get them by the second
hop, you usually don't get them," Georgi
says. We don't.
  But never mind. Right now, some
800,000 of its kin are stowed safely in
Ziploc bags in Georgi's freezer, ready for
sale. The question is, Who wants them?
  Mostly it's big drug companies and
chemical labs trying to help me-~the lady
with two cats, four dogs, and Oriental
rugs that come to life each summer as
Ctenocephalides felis, the common flea,
takes over my home.
  And helping they are. By making an
extract from Georgi's livestock, Greer
Laboratories, Inc., in Lenoir, North Car-
olina, can now offer allergists and veteri-
narians antigen tests to tell whether you
or your dog or cat are itching because of
fleas or something else.
  Even better, during the past few years
companies have come up with a genuine
flea-relief breakthrough: new age com-
pounds called insect growth regulators.
  It's about time that something did the
trick. Professional exterminators say fleas
come right after cockroaches and termites
as the nation's most troublesome pests.
Consider that 110 million dogs and cats
are scattered among the nation's 94 mil-
lion households. And that fleas can be
debilitating to young animals and tor-
turous to those with allergies. In regions
of high humidity, flea allergy dermatitis is
the number one complaint at the vet's.
Americans spend a million dollars a day
fighting fleas at home and almost three
times that much-~$1 billion each year-~if
you figure in vet bills and exterminators.
  "Oh well, `A reasonable amount of
fleas is good for a dog,'" says Georgi,
quoting homespun philosopher David
