fed baby, who may need vitamin D. Be-
cause sunlight is a major source of vita-
min D, and skin pigmentation can affect
the absorption of this nutrient, breast-
fed babies born in cold climates or to
African-American mothers may also re-
quire vitamin D supplements.

Q. My children don't like meat. Are
they missing important nutrients by
leaving it on their plates?
A. Not if they eat other foods that pro-
vide what meat offers. From dairy prod-
ucts they get protein. Vegetables and
fruit provide vitamins and other essen-
tials. Most children eat poultry and
some like fish, both good sources of
iron. If your children are excluding all
meat, poultry, and fish, consult a pedia-
trician or qualified nutritionist to make
sure their diets meet essential needs.

Q. My son's nine-year-old friend is
never allowed sweets in his own home.
When he visits us, he helps himself to
cookies and can easily consume several
bowls of sweetened breakfast cereal in a
short time. Is his family's no-sweets rule
making him a "closet sweet eater?"
A. Yes. Whenever certain foods are for-
bidden by parents, but are still available
to children, children will find ways to eat
them. Your son's friend has found a
black market to satisfy his sweet tooth.
And these foods are even more tasty be-
cause they are being eaten on the sly.
This is one of the reasons why I don't
think mothers should put any foods on a
"good" or "bad" list, even sweets. Any
food is appropriate as long as it doesn't
make a child sick. I'm not suggesting
that you provide candy bars for dessert
at every meal, but offering cookies or ice
cream on occasion is fine.

Q. Are peanuts really bad for toddlers?
A. Yes. Small round or hard foods like
peanuts or hot dogs can become lodged
in a small child's windpipe, producing
anything from pneumonia to complete
blockage of the airway. Pediatricians
strongly discourage feeding toddlers
small, hard foods.

Q. Is breast milk really better for my
newborn daughter? I prefer to bottle
feed, but my mother-in-law is making
me feel terribly guilty about my choice.
A. Breast milk is the optimal food for
babies, but as far as growth and develop-
ment are concerned, there is little differ-
ence between formula-fed and breast-
fed infants. If your baby is average and
healthy, you aren't putting her at any
risk by choosing formula.

Q. When is the best time to wean a baby
from the breast or bottle?
A. There is no "best" time. Babies may
