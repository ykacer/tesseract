GO AFTER THE FLEAS ON
THE DOG OR CAT

Attack first with a flea comb (available for
less than $10 in any pet shop). Dunk the
combed-out fleas into a bowl of soapy
water-~quick, before they jump.
Wash your pet with a gentle shampoo and
sponge on an insecticide dip. Some people
prefer products with plant poisons such
as pyrethrins (from chrysanthemum flow-
ers) or D-limonene (from citrus peels). But
because some compounds are toxic to
cats and risky for infants, it's best to talk
over your whole chemical strategy with
a veterinarian.
Don't bet on flea collars. Scientists have
now tested dozens of fancy new "ultra-
sonic" collars and say flat out that they
don't work. In one test, some pet owners
were given functioning collars; some oth-
ers got ones without batteries. Both groups
were equally pleased with the results.
  The more traditional insecticide-laced
collars do hurt fleas but release their poi-
son quickly and only up near the head.
Many vets advise against them.
  One possible exception is the new Ovi-
trol collar with insect growth regulators.
It should help keep fleas from reproducing.
Ignore your friends' advice. Trust me:
All the "alternative" methods are about
as effective as snapping your fingers to
keep elephants away. Garlic, brewer's
yeast, pennyroyal oil, cedar chips, euca-
lyptus nuts-~they've all been touted as
remedies. But science asks for evidence-~
dead fleas, itchless pets-~and it's just not
there. In fact, veterinarian Jay Georgi
once raised healthy flea larvae on brewer's
yeast and garlic.
