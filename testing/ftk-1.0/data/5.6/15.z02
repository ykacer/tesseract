 GASOLINE
IN OREGON:

EVERY TIME YOU FILL UP
YOUR CAR IN OREGON, YOU
TAKE A CHANCE OF BUYING
SUBSTANDARD GASOLINE.
WHY ISN'T IT TESTED?

    Dean E. Conder might
    hold the record for the
    worst gasoline mileage
    of all time.
  He filled up the tank of his 1992
Buick Park Avenue at a Bend
service station last summer and
drove from the pump to the street
before his car stalled.
  The 74-year-old retired judge
from Salt Lake City got the car
running and made it a few more
blocks before the car died again.
This time it wouldn't budge.
  The mechanic at a nearby
Buick dealership didn't take long
to diagnose the problem. Conder
bought a tank full of muddy  water.
  In fact, the repair shop estimat-
ed that Conder bought as much as
15 gallons of water.
  "I never encountered anything
like this," Conder said by tele-
phone from his Utah home.
  Conder and his wife wound up
spending four extra days in Ore-
gon while his car was repaired. He
estimated that his tank of water
cost him close to $1,000 after
adding in lodging, meals and other
expenses.
  Not long after Conder returned
home, he tuned into the television
news program "60 Minutes" and
saw a report on bad gasoline.
That's when he learned that Ore-
gon is one of six states that do not
test gasoline quality.
