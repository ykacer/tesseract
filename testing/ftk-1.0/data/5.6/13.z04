      ~isten carefully and
      you'll hear the sounds
      of summer echoing
across your neighborhood. They're
the sounds of hammers ringing and
saws singing as homeowners build
backyard decks.
  Wooden decks represent the sin-
gle most popular, do-it-yourself
home improvement project. There's
no mystery to why decks are so pop-
ular: They're easy to build, afford-
able and an economical way to gain
valuable outdoor living space. And,
decks hold their resale value.
According to a survey conducted by
Remodeling, a trade magazine for re-
modeling contractors, you can ex-
pect to recoup nearly 84 percent of a
deck's cost when you sell your home.
  Here are five distinct decks that 
range from a modest platform to an
elegant, multi-level structure. And
only basic carpentry skills are re-
quired to build them.
