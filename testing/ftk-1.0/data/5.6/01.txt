  JOHANNESBURG - Blacks were sworn in as pre-
miers of seven of South Africa's nine provinces and the
first democratically elected provincial parliaments
opened for business yesterday as the peaceful turnover
of power began.
  President-elect Nelson Mandela, leader of the Afri-
can National Congress, made the rounds in Cape Town,
where he is to preside tomorrow over the first session of
the national assembly.
  Mandela, under fire from within the ANC for contro-
versial Cabinet appointments, attended Sabbath services
at an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in the Cape Town sub-
urb of Seapoint, where he appealed to Jewish emigrants
to return to South Africa.
  "We are going to rely to a great extent on their con-
tribution in building a new South Africa," he said. "You
have no reason to fear a government of national unity."
  Mandela also said that the living standards of white
South Africans would not be affected by the uplifting of
blacks.
  Mandela said that he hopes to meet President Ezer
Weizman of Israel and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, "for a handshake to
encourage the forces working for peace in the Middle
East."
  Arafat and Weizman, along with Vice President Al
Gore, are among the scores of dignitaries and political
leaders who will attend the inauguration of Mandela on
Tuesday as the first black president of South Africa.

ca since the first all-race election last month belonged to
