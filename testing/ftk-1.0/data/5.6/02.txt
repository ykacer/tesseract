Chinese
men face
solitude

  BEIJING (AP) -~ The govern-
ment says single Chinese men in
their 30s and 40s have little hope
of finding a wife in their own age
group.

  China has 7.4 million single
men ages 30-44, but only 454,600
single women in that age bracket,
the Guangming Daily newspaper
reported.

  Worse yet, the single men and
women may be ill-matched. Most
of the men are peasants with
little education, while most of the
women live in cities and have
high school or college degrees.

  The paper said the figures re-
leased by the State Statistical
Bureau showed that men who do
physical labor are least attractive
as mates, while women who work
with their minds are least popu-
lar.

  But it didn't explain why there
were 16 single men for every sin-
gle woman, or what happened to
the peasant women of those ages.

  In recent years, Chinese statis-
ticians have begun to forecast a
big marriage gap for the genera-
tion born in the late 1980s and
early '90s because of new technol-
ogy that allows women to dis-
cover the sex of their fetuses.
Many Chinese women, limited by
the government to one child, are
aborting girl fetuses so that their
one child can be a son.

  Chinese traditionally prefer
sons because they are more likely
to provide support in old age and
because they carry on the family
line. In 1990, China recorded
113.8 male births for every 100
female births, far higher than the
natural ratio of 106 to 100.

  However, census figures for the
1950s and early '60s, when to-
day's 30- to 44-year-olds were
born, do not show any such gap.
