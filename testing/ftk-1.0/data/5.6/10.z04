ington Post and Newsweek, announced
that she was going straight home. This
was thought to be a reproach, even a
gesture (though it later transpired that
Mrs. G. actually had the flu). In the re-
sulting flutter of reaction, Lady Rams-
botham vowed to discontinue the age-
old practice of "ladies' withdrawal," and
in swift succession nearly every George-
town mansion followed suit. "The only
exception was Pamela Harriman's," says
Peter Jay, who succeeded Sir Peter
Ramsbotham as ambassador, "and ev-
eryone knows that Mrs. Harriman is a
law unto herself."
  True, no doubt, but that law, however
phrased, is still something of an English
law. It was the British who started the
idea of strict precedence and sexual seg-
regation at Washington dinners. Pamela
Harriman operates at the crucial inter-
section of Washington where living mem-
ories of Churchill and the Blitz-~shared
by veterans such as herself and Evange-
line Bruce-~mingle with high liberal
politics and elevated social tone. You
might not prove a connection between
Anglophilia and the Georgetown Demo-
cratic establishment, because proving
such a thing would be vulgar and strenu-
ous. But you may nonetheless assume it
and not go far wrong. The embassy
helps set the pitch and rhythm, both for
those who don't say "Shall we join the
ladies?" and for those who do.
  This spring, the British ambassador
and his lady threw a little dinner dance
for Harriman. It wasn't too shabby, es-
pecially if you bore in mind that it was
to honor her being gazetted as ambassa-
dor designate to France. The Senate For-
eign Relations Committee hadn't yet had
the privilege of confirming Harriman,
and the French Embassy hadn't gotten
around to organizing its own f~~te, so the
British had managed to pre-empt both
the Congress and America's oldest ally.
I counted Les Aspin, Vernon Jordan,
Alan Greenspan, Richard Helms, Mick-

Daschle and Pryor were on deck. So were
the aristocracy, from Susan Mary Alsop,
Mrs. Vincent Astor, Evangeline Bruce,
