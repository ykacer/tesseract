  It happened to Herbert Sharp soon
after he was hired as a Rocky Hill police
officer in 1989.
  He was living in Hartford, so he went
to Rocky Hill one evening to drive
around and learn the layout of his new
beat.
  But he learned something else in-
stead. Sharp, who is black, was followed
for miles by a white police officer until
he left Rocky Hill.
