the Hunts Point Market sure-
ly still will be telling the story
of Dominick and the 1994
basketball pool.
  The market's annual pool is
taken as seriously as the
price of arugula, and the en-
trants include people who
have spent decades studying
scores and players and
coaches. Several have been
known to bet as much as
$10,000 on a single game.
  Yet, the first round of this
year's pool found neither
Short Petey nor Fat Bubba,
or any of the other experts, in
the lead. The early leader
was instead an unknown from
C & S Produce named Domi-
nick. Several entrants were
prompted to inquire about
him at C & S, and they were
told he was the son of the
firm's founder, John Cag-
giano.
  The next round showed
Dominick still in the lead,
and the entrants became a lit-
tle more curious. They now
asked John Caggiano his
son's age. The answer
brought a universal response.
  "They didn't believe me,"
John says.
  John managed to convince
them of the truth. They recov-
ered from the shock enough
to suggest that his son must
be the luckiest 6-year-old on
earth.
