ra-cotta border tiles. If your home al-
ready has a concrete patio, you can
simply lay tile directly over it using
thin-set mortar. If the patio is too
small, enlarge it by excavating, forming
and pouring a concrete extension.
  Redwood was chosen for this pro-
ject because of its natural beauty, di-
mensional stability and resistance to rot
and insect infestation. (Note that this is
true only of the heartwood grades of
redwood cut from the center of the log.
The sapwood grades offer less resis-
tance.) The understructure frame of
the sun deck was built of 2~8 redwood
joists spaced 24 in. on-center. The left-
hand end of the deck (closest to the
house) rests on the concrete patio and
is nailed to a pressure-treated 2~4 cleat.
The cleat is fastened to the patio with
lead expansion shields and ~~~-in.-dia. ~
3-in. lag screws.
  The 2~6 redwood decking was 
nailed to the joists with galvanized
common nails. Redwood is soft and 
easy to nail, but be sure to pre-drill
pilot holes at the boards' ends to pre-
vent splitting.
  On the landing, at the base of the
stairs, is a cozy redwood bench con-
structed of 4~4s and 2~6s. Above the
bench is a modest shade arbor featuring
an overhead lattice made of 2~2s. Each
of the steps in the stairway leading to
the balcony deck is made of seven red-
wood 2~4s. The 2~4s were bolted to-
gether to form massive 3~~~-in.-thick ~
10~~~-in.-deep steps.
  The balcony deck is built off the
upstairs master bedroom and offers a
private perch for enjoying the Sunday
morning paper. The deck is enclosed
with a railing made of 4~4 posts, 2~4
rails and a 2~6 cap. Note that the 2~4
rails were installed horizontally to cre-
ate fewer obstructions and offer a bet-
ter view than would have vertical
balusters.
