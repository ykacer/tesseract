REDWOOD AND TILE

Two beautiful and enduring materials,
select-heart redwood and natural slate,
were used to create this unusual back-
yard deck. The design features a con-
crete patio that's covered with
12~12-in. gray slate tiles. The patio ex-
tends out from the house and merges
with a redwood sun deck. The deck is
connected to a landing and set of stairs
that leads to a second-story balcony
deck (see photograph, page 45).
