  Residents say this
wasn't the first time an
innocent victim was
killed by a stray bullet
in their neighborhood.
  "About 12 people have
been killed like this
over the past two or 
three years," said 50-
year-old Juan Rivera.
  "The police [station
house] is just two blocks
from here, and we
never see enough cops.
  "The neighborhood is
being overrun with
drug dealers," he said.
"How can we live like
this?"
  On Tuesday, Michelle
McKie, a 14-year-old
honor student, lost her
eye after she was hit
outside her high school
in Queens.
  And on Sunday, Tessa
Warren was killed by a
stray bullet fired
through the window of
her apartment in
Brooklyn as a basket-
ball fan sprayed the
area with bullets in
celebration of a Knicks
victory.
  "It highlights the gun
problem that we have
in this city and in this
country," Police Com-
missioner William
Bratton said.
