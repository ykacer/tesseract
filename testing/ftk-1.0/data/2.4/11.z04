  In an ongoing Harvard Medical School
study, male doctors with heart conditions
who took 50 mg of beta carotene every
other day had fewer heart attacks, strokes,
and deaths related to heart disease than
those who did not. Charles Hennekens,
M.D., professor of preventive medicine at
Harvard Medical School, found, too, that
elderly people who ate vegetables high in
beta carotene had a lower risk of dying
from heart disease and that women who
consumed beta carotene- and vitamin
E-rich diets (and/or took supplements of
these nutrients) had 22 percent fewer car-
diovascular problems.
  According to Gladys Block, Ph.D., an
epidemiologist at the University of
California at Berkeley, a summary of more
than ninety studies suggests that high vi-
tamin C intake significantly reduces the
risk of cancers of the oral cavity, esopha-
gus, stomach and cervix.	(continued)
