ment came overwhelmingly from
Democrats, 149 Democrats op-
posed it. Six Republicans voted
yes. Amendment supporters ar-
gued that the death penalty costs
too much, fails to deter crime and
encroaches on state judicial over-
sight.
  But opponents said the death
penalty is the sternest conse-
quence for those who commit vi-
cious crimes.
  Other attempts to exempt fed-
eral crimes from the death penalty
also failed, and lawmakers ap-
proved amendments to make it
easier to impose the death penalty
on criminals. The House is expec-
ted to vote on the anti-crime bill
this week.

  ~ Senate votes to restrict
desert development: After
eight years of on-and-off debate,
the Senate on Wednesday passed
69-29 a measure that would re-
strict development on a vast por-
tion of California desert and create
three new national parks.
  The bill, sponsored by Califor-
nia Democrat Dianne Feinstein,
would protect more than one-third
of the California desert's 25-mil-
lion acres. It is the largest land
protection measure considered by
Congress since the passage of the
Alaska Lands Act in 1980.
  Feinstein displayed numerous
pictures of the desert's unique fea-
tures in an attempt to convince her
colleagues that the bill would pro-
tect more than a vast, parched
space void of anything but sand.
  Voting to designate new wil-
derness areas in the California des-
ert: Graham (D).
  Voting against: Mack (R).
