2 girls, vulnerable to sunlight, fight genetic, community intolerance

  MERIDIAN, Calif. -~ The
Harrison family has been harassed,
shunned and ridiculed as "vam-
pires." Their truck was vandalized,
an antenna atop their house shot
off, and one of their dogs killed.

  All this because their daughters,
Jaime, 9, and Sherry, 7, have a
rare genetic intolerance for the
sun that leaves its victims vulnera-
ble to skin cancers, blindness and
neurological damage.

  The girls spend their days in-
side a dimly lit house. Only before
dawn or after dusk can they ven-
ture out for typical kid pastimes
like school, ballet, judo and camp-
ing.
  "When it gets dark, we go out
to play," Jaime said.

  In the 7~~~ years since the dis-
ease was diagnosed, the family has
adapted to living in the twilight.




They wish others would be more
tolerant.

  "Sometimes it seems that for
every good person, there's four or
five bad people," said Jim Harri-
son, 38, a cabinetmaker and part-
time judo instructor.

  After experiencing persistent
harassment while living in Illinois
and other northern California
towns, the family found relative
peace in this tiny Sutter County
town four years ago. Meridian is
about 70 miles north of Sacramen-
to.

  A television movie about the
Harrisons will bring new attention.
Kim Harrison, 34, said they are
willing to trade some privacy to
help educate others.

  "Children of the Dark," starring
Peter Horton and Tracy Pollan,
airs at 9 tonight on Channel 4. "I
think it would make a lot of dif-
ference for the movie to come out,
and more people will know," said




Kim Harrison, the girls' mother.

  The Harrison girls have xerod-
erma pigmentosum, or XP, an of-
ten-fatal disorder. Only one in
about 250,000 people carries the
gene. Because the gene is reces-
sive, both parents have to carry it
for the disorder to be passed on.
Even then the chances are one in
four of having a child with XP.

  It is not contagious. The girls'
16-year-old half-brother, Bobby,
does not have the disorder.

  Growing up in Aurora, Ill.,
Jaime showed symptoms early. Ba-
by pictures show her screwing her
eyes shut and turning her head
from the sun. Her skin burned
badly, though usually not for 24 to
48 hours after exposure.

  Doctors initially thought she
had a rash or allergies.

  On a camping trip in 1986,
Jaime became seriously ill and had
to be hospitalized. Photos show
her skin a mass of blisters. Her
eyes were swollen shut. Her mouth
was so cracked and raw she
couldn't drink from her bottle.

  A skin biopsy revealed XP.
Doctors said she would likely die
at an early age from melanoma
cancer.
  Sherry was tested a short time
later; the results were the same.

  "As far as giving it to the kids,
we felt really bad about ourselves
for a long time. ... We felt very
defective," Mrs. Harrison said.
"We've learned a lot since then.
We understand that all kinds of
people have gone through things
like this."
 
  Mrs. Harrison has started an in-
formal network for people with
XP. She has heard from about 25




healthy.

  They attend school three days a
week. Teachers cover the windows
when the girls are there. The sis-
ters also study at home.

  Jaime said she doesn't mind
staying indoors. But Sherry, who
has never been exposed to direct
sunlight, sometimes chafes under
the restriction.

  The Harrison house overflows
with toys and animals. One room
looks like an indoor playground
with a giant inner tube, climbing
bars and a small pool filled with
plastic balls instead of water.

  "They're doing well medically.
They're doing well socially. They're
doing well in school," Mrs. Harri-
son said. "I think we've proved a
point. And that's not what we set
out to do. We wanted to save our
children."
