mations of this rock have been recognized and mapped
by Messrs. Emmons and Garrey.  These formations are
not necessarily individual flows. Some of them are really
parts of a single thick flow, and others are certainly com-
posed of several flows. Intercalated between the rhyo-
lites are five flows of plagioclase basalt, one flow of 
quartz latite, some stratified tuffs, and finally capping the
series, a flow of quartz-bearing basalt. The effusive 
rocks are cut by intrusions of rhyolitic porphyry, plagio-
clase basalt, and leucite basanite. Most of the basalt
dikes occupy fault fissures.
  The Tertiary lavas and tuffs are generally conformable
to one another, but at a few places slight erosional un-
conformity has been detected.
  The entire series of volcanic rocks is divided by faults
into a large number of blocks in each of which the flows
are in general tilted to the east at angles up to 40~. The 
fault planes strike from northwest to northeast and dip
generally to the west.  The displacement as a general 
rule, is normal; that is, the hanging wall in each case
has slipped down relative to the foot wall.  In conse-
quence of this structure anyone traveling across the dis-
trict from west to east will see the edges of the same 
flows repeated again and again in the successive western
fronts of the ridges.

In regard to the veins they say:
    Most of the lodes are not simple veins, but are fissure
  zones (of nearly vertical dip) containing numerous vein-
  lets or stringers of vein material and in most cases show-
  ing no definite walls. The principal stringers are parallel
  with the sides of the lode as a whole, but they are linked 
  by numerous irregular cross veinlets, and similar small
  stringers extend for varying distances into the country
  rock. The lodes range in width from a few inches to 10
  or even 100 feet.
    Typical vein quartz, such as is characteristic of the
  gold veins of the Appalachians or Sierra Nevada or such
  as is found in the pre-Tertiary schists of the Bullfrog
  district, does not occur in the mines near Rhyolite, with
  the exception of the Original Bullfrog.  The quarts is
  prevailingly fine grained, often of a porcelain-like tex-
  ture, and is usually intercrystallized with calcite.
