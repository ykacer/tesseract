(continued)  research, even some long-
time skeptics seem to be won over. "I was
in front of the band of naysayers," admits
Godfrey Oakley, M.D., director of the di-
vision of birth defects and developmental
disabilities at the Centers for Disease
Control, in Atlanta. "But I changed my
mind when I saw that folic acid can pre-
vent certain birth defects."

Vitamins with clout
Vitamins, organic substances that are es-
sential for normal metabolism and
growth, help regulate protective chemical
reactions in the body. Scientists have long
known that these compounds prevent de-
ficiency diseases such as scurvy, rickets,
beriberi, pellagra and night blindness,
which are virtually unknown in the U.S.
today because of improved diet and forti-
fied foods. But over the years, a variety of
nutrients have been touted by health au-
thorities and vitamin faddists alike to
have quasi-miraculous powers against
other ailments. The most popular asser-
tions are that vitamin C quashes colds; vi-




tamin B6 allays the symptoms of PMS; and
vitamin E counters infertility in women.
  Though studies failed to prove such
claims definitively, health-conscious
Americans boosted supplement sales to
$3 billion in 1990, more than doubling
revenues since 1976. And now, it turns out,
the boomers' faith in vitamins as vanguards
of preventive medicine may be justified.
  Consider some recent studies:
The antioxidant compounds Vitamins C
and E and beta carotene (a compound,
plentiful in dark-green and orange
vegetables, that the body can convert into
vitamin A) have been shown to provide the
most pronounced benefits by counteracting
unstable molecule particles called free radi-
cals. These chemicals, which are produced
by the body and also formed in the envi-
ronment, can damage cells and promote
heart disease, cancer and other disorders.
  Antioxidants may help prevent heart
disease-~the nation's leading killer-~by
inhibiting LDL (low-density lipoprotein,
or "bad" cholesterol) from oxidizing
and forming fatty deposits on artery




walls, notes Ishwarlal Jialal, M.D.,
co-director of the Lipid Clinic at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medi-
cal Center, in Dallas.
  In an ongoing Harvard Medical School
study, male doctors with heart conditions
who took 50 mg of beta carotene every
other day had fewer heart attacks, strokes,
and deaths related to heart disease than
those who did not. Charles Hennekens,
M.D., professor of preventive medicine at
Harvard Medical School, found, too, that
elderly people who ate vegetables high in
beta carotene had a lower risk of dying
from heart disease and that women who
consumed beta carotene- and vitamin
E-rich diets (and/or took supplements of
these nutrients) had 22 percent fewer car-
diovascular problems.
  According to Gladys Block, Ph.D., an
epidemiologist at the University of
California at Berkeley, a summary of more
than ninety studies suggests that high vi-
tamin C intake significantly reduces the
risk of cancers of the oral cavity, esopha-
gus, stomach and cervix.	(continued)
