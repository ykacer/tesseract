4 ~ 100-meter relay team. Cornerback
James Trapp, a third-round draft choice,
was an alternate on that same relay team.
And maybe there'll be Ismail, who can
hang with any of these guys.
  It's a freakish team. "There are lots of
fast football players," says Gault. "It's be-
come a speed game. But there's speed
and there's elite speed. As far as elite
speed, the league's got about a dozen
such players. We have half of them."
  This is not necessarily an advantage. Of
those six, only Gault and McDaniel have
made any kind of impact. But, as far as
Davis is concerned, speed is the way to go.
  Growing up in Brooklyn, Davis was in-
trigued by both the Yankees and the
Dodgers. "The Yankees had power, size,
and created fear," he says. "The Dodgers
believed in speed and in development;
they were willing to take chances. For the
Raiders, I wanted both. I never could un-
derstand why you couldn't have both."
  Speed means big plays and sudden
strikes that demoralize opponents with
their swiftness. Having speed puts tre-
mendous pressure on defenses. Davis be-
lieves that his sprinters don't have to
catch the ball to be dangerous. Their pres-
ence is electric enough to alter a game's
dynamics, moving the defense off the line
and creating space for an offense.
"Speed," says Davis, "is an integral part
of fear. As you know, we've always said
we'd rather be feared than respected."
  Davis was The Citadel's chief recruiter
in 1955, when he landed an All-America
sprinter out of Philadelphia named Ange-
lo Coia. Coia enjoyed a seven-year career
in the NFL and, not at all incidentally,
is now a scout for the Raiders. The bias of
the personnel department toward
speed-~Kent McCloughan, a former
Raider cornerback, is another scout who
was a high school All-America in track-~
is as natural as it is mandated. To this day,
part of a Raider scouting report is a work-
up on the player's high school track
experience.
  This emphasis doesn't always pay off.
Bo Roberson was a silver medalist in the
1960 Games in the long jump, and al-
though Davis kept him on the Raiders for
four seasons, he is not remembered as
having been anything more than a "com-
plement" to the offense. Jimmy Hines,
one of those sensational sprinters that
came out of Texas in the '60s, was picked
up by Davis even though his nickname
was Ooops! and two other teams had
