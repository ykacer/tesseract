  Donald Swann, whose impish
demeanor and owl-eyed expres-
sions made him the more outgoing
half of the jocular team of Flanders
and Swann, has died in London.
  The Associated Press on Friday
quoted a family spokesman as say-
ing he had died Wednesday in a
London hospital. Swann was 70 
and fighting prostate cancer.
  Best known for their eccentric
revues of the 1950s and '60s-~"At
the Drop of a Hat" and "At the Drop
of Another Hat,"  Michael Flanders
and Swann paid homage in song
and verse to unusual themes.
  A perennial favorite ode was to a
hippopotamus:
  "Mud, mud, glorious mud, there's
nothing quite like it for cooling the 
blood."
  They also celebrated wart hogs,
the London bus system, the gnu
and the armadillo.  An added touch
was that they sang of these non
sequiturs in several languages, in-
cluding Greek and Latin.
  Their blend of odd humor and
biting satire made them world
favorites until Flanders' health
failed.
  Because of childhood polio, he
used a wheelchair and gave up
touring in 1967.  Flanders died in
1975.
