rate of dissolution for Rainier Mesa rock was found to be
6.87 ~ 10-3 mg m-2 hr-1.

Determination of the Equation for Silica
Mass Transfer in Rainier Mesa

	Experiment 3 established that the rate of mass trans-
fer of the constituents from Rainier Mesa glass is dependent
on the reactive surface area to water volume ratio, ~, in
addition to temperature. The average total surface area of
the glass samples used to determine the kinetic rate was
93.6 square meters. If this value, along with the rate
constant obtained for the temperature of the rock and the
value of b given in Table 4 are used in equation 8, the
equation of mass transfer of silica into the groundwater of
Rainier Mesa is obtained:




The Time, Surface Area, Silica Concentration
Relationship for Rainier Mesa Groundwaters

	If Rainier Mesa precipitation is assumed void of all
silica (Freeze and Cherry, 1979) Qo equals 0.0, and equa-
tion 16 becomes:
