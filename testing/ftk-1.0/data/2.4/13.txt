  Former President Richard M. Nix-
on's body will be flown to California
on Tuesday and will lie in state in
the lobby of the Richard Nixon Li-
brary and Birthplace in Yorba Linda.
  Public viewing begins at 3 p.m.
Tuesday and will continue through
the night until 11 a.~. Wednesday.
  Services are scheduled for 4 p.m.
Wednesday at the Nixon Library,
with the Rev. Billy Graham officiat-
ing. Graham also presided over the
funeral last year of Nixon's wife, Pat.
A private burial will follow at the
library near Pat Nixon's grave.
  Eulogies will be delivered by Presi-
dent Clinton, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole (R., Kan.) and California
Gov. Pete Wilson.
  Nixon's office said messages and
flowers can be sent to the library at

Linda, Calif. 92686.
  The library's telephone number is

  Former Nixon aide David Gergen -~
now a top adviser to Clinton -~ was
asked about Nixon's choice not to lie
in state in the Capitol in Washington,
and said Nixon "had often thought
Congress had tormented him."
  "I think that whether he decided
that it was a matter of propriety and
he didn't want to raise some of the 
painful questions about the past about

and he often thought Congress had
tormented him," Gergen said.
  More generally, he said, "I'm not
sure the exact reason, or they
wanted something very simple. Rich-
ard Nixon, you know, he was a man
who gave up his Secret Service pro-
tection. He didn't want a lot of the
trappings of power later in life."
  Gergen added: "I think he just sort
of wanted to fade away and go back
to Yorba Linda."
  That was not how Nixon planned it
more than 20 years ago, before Wa-
tergate, before Senate hearings, be-

tion to statesman.
