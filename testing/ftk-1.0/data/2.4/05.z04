  The Harrison girls have xerod-
erma pigmentosum, or XP, an of-
ten-fatal disorder. Only one in
about 250,000 people carries the
gene. Because the gene is reces-

Even then the chances are one in

to be hospitalized. Photos show
her skin a mass of blisters. Her
eyes were swollen shut. Her mouth
was so cracked and raw she
couldn't drink from her bottle.

  A skin biopsy revealed XP.
Doctors said she would likely die
at an early age from melanoma
cancer.
  Sherry was tested a short time
later; the results were the same.

we felt really bad about ourselves

defective," Mrs. Harrison said.
"We've learned a lot since then.
We understand that all kinds of
people have gone through things
like this."
 
  Mrs. Harrison has started an in-
formal network for people with
XP. She has heard from about 25
