Swann had been the bemused
pianist of the act, performing the
Flanders-Swann repertoire with
an expression on his face that
indicated he might be slightly daft.
  The bearded and more subdued
Flanders sat at his side in his
wheelchair offering up jokes that
Swann found more hilarious than
they sometimes were.  Many times
Swann was the object of Flanders'
derision.
  Swann was born in Wales, but
was half-Russian and grew up 
speaking the language.
  He performed in theatrical re-
vues at Christ Church College,
Oxford.  A conscientious objector,
he returned to Oxford after World
War II where he performed refu-
gee relief work in the Middle 
East.
  There he teamed with Flanders,
the lyricist for the two.
  Flanders and Swann first won
fame in 1956 with "At the Drop of a
Hat," which ran for more than
1,700 performances in London's
West End and on Broadway for
more than 200 performances.
  After the partnership ended,
Swann continued to compose but
never regained his popular success.
  He wrote an opera, "Perelan-
dra," song cycles and cantatas and
dozens of instrumental works.
  Survivors include his wife, Ali-
son, and two daughters.
