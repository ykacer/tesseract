Russia cannot
have everything

  PARIS -~ It's easy to laugh at Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
  "I salute Paris as the city of Arabs in 10 or 20 years," the lead-
er of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party said caustically on his
arrival in France with a reluctantly granted visa that limited him to
Charles de Gaulle airport and the eastern city of Strasbourg, the
seat of the Council of Europe.
  "A visa like that doesn't even exist for blacks. Why not specify
the toilets where I can urinate (not exactly the word he used) or the
lunch room where I can eat?"
  And again: "It's finished for France. The same for Germany,
where Turks are dominant. Only Russia will remain a white coun-




try."
  Zhirinovsky, 47, had al-
ready been barred or kicked
out of several countries, in-
cluding Bulgaria, Germany,
Slovenia and Spain. But
since the Council of Europe
had invited a delegation




from the Russian Parliament and Zhirinovsky was a member of it,
the French couldn't keep him out. And nobody could shut him up.
  "It's Russia that should be examining the Council of Europe,
not the Council of Europe that should be examining Russia," Zhiri-
novsky said when he addressed the session which is examining the
possibility of Russian membership in the 32-member body. Most of
the parliamentarians tried to pretend he wasn't there.
  "We don't want to be either Zionized, Islamized or American-
ized," he said."
  When jeered by a group of young Jewish demonstrators outside
the conference hall, he took refuge behind the iron gates of the Rus-
sian consulate, ripped out some potted plants and began throwing
them and spitting at his tormenters.
  "If I were in Yeltsin's place, we would now be bombing the
NATO bases in Italy," he said when he heard about the NATO
bombing of the Serbs near Gorazde. "This is a war against Russia,
Orthodox Christians and the Slavic people."
  And when he finally left on Thursday, he claimed that someone
at the Council of Europe, the oldest and most august of Europe's
democratic institutions, had stolen his hat.
  It's easy to laugh at Zhirinovsky as a clown. But it would be
very wrong. He is the dark side of Russia incarnate, voicing the
frustrations, prejudices and hatreds of millions of ordinary Russians
who made his party the largest single group in the new State Duma.
You can almost hear the murmurs of approval as he speaks.
  He taps into not only present frustrations but a deep vein of ul-
tranationalism that is anti-foreigner and anti-Semitic and highly
dangerous.
  Zhirinovsky wants to succeed Boris Yeltsin as president, wants
to restore the Russian empire as it was, with Ukraine and the Baltic
states as provinces.
  My own guess is that other sinister and smarter men would
soon take over, but the Russia he and they represent would not be
easy to live with. And his very existence is enough to explain Presi-
dent Clinton's efforts to bolster Boris Yeltsin.
  While he and Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev have them-
selves been forced into an increasingly nationalistic line since last
December's elections, while their reforms have been slowed, they
nevertheless represent the best and most democratic alternative.
  At a time when the United States and United Nations have a
desperate need this weekend for Russia to help find the way out of
a Bosnian crisis in which they have again threatened and flinched,
the antics of a Zhirinovsky are a reminder of the central position of
Russia now and in the future.
