170		LAKE BONNEVILLE.




Salt Lake. By reason of its position at the top of the series, it is the most
conspicuous of all; but the one most deeply carved is the Provo, 375 feet
lower. Between the Bonneville and Provo are the Intermediate shore-
lines, characterized by embankments of great size, but without correspond-
ingly great sea-cliffs and terraces. Below the Provo the slopes exhibit lake
sediments, with occasional shore-lines superposed. Of these latter the Stans-
bury is the most prominent.
  The area of the lake at the Bonneville stage was 19,750 square miles;
at the Provo stage, about 13,000 square miles; at the Stansbury stage, about
7,000 square miles.
  The order of sequence of the shores to which names have been given
is: first, Intermediate; second, Bonneville; third, Provo; fourth, Stansbury.
During the period of the formation of the Intermediate embankments, there
were no persistent water stages; but the water surface oscillated up and
down. The last additions to the embankments were made during a gen-
eral advance of the water. The oscillation of the water surface continued
through the Bonneville epoch, the Bonneville shore representing the com-
bined results of wave action at a series of water levels having a vertical
range of 20 feet. The last stage of this series was the highest, and imme-
diately afterward the surface fell rapidly to the Provo horizon, where it
remained a long time. The water margin afterward receded from the
Provo shore to its present position, halting occasionally by the way, and
longest at the Stansbury shore.
