  Well, that's a story of politics and
pride.
  The Army plans to give the
tanks to its National Guard units,
which in the past have been notori-
ously poorly trained and under-
equipped with cast-off gear nobody
else wanted.
  During the Persian Gulf war,
three Guard combat brigades were
activated for service, but to the
Army's intense embarrassment,
they were judged unready for war
and had to stay home.
