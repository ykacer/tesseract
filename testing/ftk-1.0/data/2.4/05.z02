  MERIDIAN, Calif. -~ The
Harrison family has been harassed,
shunned and ridiculed as "vam-
pires." Their truck was vandalized,
an antenna atop their house shot
off, and one of their dogs killed.

  All this because their daughters,
Jaime, 9, and Sherry, 7, have a
rare genetic intolerance for the
sun that leaves its victims vulnera-
ble to skin cancers, blindness and
neurological damage.

  The girls spend their days in-
side a dimly lit house. Only before
dawn or after dusk can they ven-
ture out for typical kid pastimes
like school, ballet, judo and camp-
ing.
  "When it gets dark, we go out
to play," Jaime said.

  In the 7~~~ years since the dis-
ease was diagnosed, the family has
adapted to living in the twilight.
