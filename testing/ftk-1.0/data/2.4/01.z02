shown, together with minor domes over Nova Scotia, New-
foundland, Devon Island, Iceland, and elsewhere. The Cor-
dilleran ice divide probably had several domes. Ice-free areas
existed on the headlands between fiords, particularly in Baf-
fin Island and Greenland; and on the lee side of islands
separating ice streams, such as Banks Island. The pattern of
flowlines and basal thermal conditions shown is the one used
for the single-dome maximum Laurentide ice sheet recon-
struction in Chapter 6. Key: Thick solid lines are ice-sheet or
ice-cap margins, thick dashed lines are ice-shelf grounding
lines, thin solid lines are surface flowlines on grounded ice
sheets or ice caps, and thin dotted lines are their extensions
on floating ice shelves. Areas covered by large dots have
thawed or partially thawed beds, with thawed beds beneath
ice streams and partially thawed beds in zones of basal melt-
ing or freezing (the density of large dots is qualitatively pro-
portional to the degree of ice-bed uncoupling due to thawed
basal conditions). Areas covered by small dots denote sea ice
extent (the density of small dots is greatest along sea-ice
margins). Black areas are open seas beyond the ice-sheet
marine margins, and white blocks scattered in the black areas
represent tabular icebergs calved from these margins (partic-
ularly from ice shelves and where calving bays are migrating
up surging ice streams). Horizontal ruled lines along terres-
trial ice-sheet margins show sectors bordered by proglacial
lakes (no attempt is made to show the areal extent of these
lakes). Heavy broken lines in Figure 2-4 show the approxi-
mate inner and outer boundaries of the Canadian Shield.
Outlines of ice sheets are adapted from Figure 2-2, with
arbitrary ice borders drawn in places where Figure 2-2 lacks
information. Ice shelves are entirely hypothetical and there-
fore were not depicted in Figure 2-2; the possibility that such
ice shelves existed is discussed in Chapter 8.
