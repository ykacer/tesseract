  House lawmakers Thursday
narrowly rejected 202-216 an at-
tempt to put the House on record
as supporting Senate-approved
language calling for additional
spending cuts over the next five
years.
  The House and the Senate
have already approved their re-
spective versions of the fiscal 1995
budget blueprint. The key differ-

that the Senate version includes an
additional $26.1-billion in spending
cuts over five years.
  House and Senate conferees
will now meet to agree on a com-

plan.
  Advocates of increased deficit
reduction, led by Timothy J. Pen-

R-Ohio, had hoped to compel

Senate spending cut.
  "Let's just say yes one time to
one spending cut, on a bipartisan
basis," said Kasich.
  Opponents of the Penny-Kasich
amendment argued that the Sen-
ate cut would take needed money
away from national defense, educa-
tion and criminal justice.
  Voting to urge House confer-
ees to accept $26-billion in spend-
ing cuts: Canady (R), Fowler (R),
Lewis (R), McCollum (R), Mica
(R), Miller (R), Ros-Lehtinen (R),
Stearns (R).
  Voting against: Bacchus (D),
Brown (D), Gibbons (D), Hutto
(D), Johnston (D), Meek (D),
Peterson (D), Thurman (D), Bili-
rakis (R), Goss (R), Young (R).

substitute as part of the $15-billion
anti-crime bill.
  The amendment, which would
have replaced life in prison for all
crimes subject to the bill's death
penalty provisions, failed by a vote
of 111-314.
