  Well, the Corps has always prac-
ticed reverse snobbery: It proudly
spends less money and has gener-
ally shabbier gear than everyone
else (the Corps doesn't give its Ma-
rines uniforms; it only lends them).
Despite this handicap, or perhaps
because of it, Marines say they can
outfight anybody.
  But they don't have the cash for
new tanks, which would cost close
to a billion dollars (the other serv-
ices lose at least that much in a
typical year).
