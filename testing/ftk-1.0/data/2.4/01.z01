Figure 2-4 A glaciological reconstruction of the North
American ice cover between 21,000 and 17,000 BP. A single
Laurentide dome is postulated over Hudson Bay because
postglacial isostatic uplift is greatest there, but the bed was
frozen beneath this dome because few, if any, erratics of
Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from Hudson Bay are found on
the surrounding Precambrian crystalline shield along the ice
divide. Ice streams are shown occupying the fore-deepened
interisland channels on the Arctic continental shelf and in
the ring of elongated lakes radiating from Hudson Bay and
located along the outer boundary of the shield. Floating ice
tongues and ice shelves may have formed beyond ice streams
occupying interisland channels. The extension of a grounded
portion of the Arctic Ocean ice-shelf cover onto northern
Alaska is entirely hypothetical, as discussed in Chapter 8.
Grounded ice lobes and ice fans formed beyond ice streams
occupying elongated lakes. Ice shelves probably became par-
tially grounded as they passed over sills in the narrow straits
between Baffin Island and Greenland, Greenland and Ice-
land, Iceland and the Faeroes, and the Faeroes and Scotland.
The southern Laurentide margin had a surface equilibrium
line separating an inner accumulation zone from an outer
ablation zone; the northern margin did not, except where
katabatic winds flowed down ice streams and into fiords. A
basal equilibrium line separating an inner melting zone from
an intermediate freezing zone was located about midway
across the Canadian Shield, and a second basal equilibrium
line separating the intermediate freezing zone from an outer
melting zone was located near the surface equilibrium line
along the southern Laurentide margin. The present divides
of the Hudson Bay and Great Lakes watersheds are the ap-
proximate locations of these two basal equilibrium lines (see
Chapters 5 and 6). Innuitian and Greenland domes are also
