chalcopyrite, galena, and considerable chalcocite
and silver, but no cobalt or gold. Some dissemi-
nated sulfide ores, similar to the Rhodesian ores,
have been developed near Tshinsenda.

Selebi-Pikwe, Botswana. The Selebi-Pikwe ore de-
posits are situated in eastern Botswana, 55 kilo-
meters east of the main rail link connecting South
Africa with Rhodesia, Zambia, and Zaire. The min- 
ing complex includes underground and open pit 
mining operations, concentrator, and a smelter at
the larger Pikwe deposit. The copper-nickel depos-
ists comprise two stratabound sulfide deposits 15
kilometers apart of Archean age situated in the 
highly deformed and metamorphosed gneissic
successions of the Limpopo field belt. Both dissem-
inated and massive sulfides occur in silllike bodies
of amphibolites that are conformable within quartz-
