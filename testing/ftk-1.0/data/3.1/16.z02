Depending on site topography, water bodies, and
meteorological conditions, the site representative
extreme windspeeds may be simply interpolated
values between distributions derived from ex-
isting wind station data. For sites located in
complex terrain, physical modeling may be used
to relate wind data available at an existing wind
station to expected wind characteristics at a
proposed site (Cermak [12]).

4.2 Winds at a Standard Level. The anemometer
height above ground varies from wind station to
wind station and may vary from time to time at
the same station. Thus, it is necessary to extra-
polate or interpolate the wind data to a standard
height. The standard height shall be 33 ft (10 m).
The extrapolation shall be done by the power law:
