like that's about had its run.
PLAYBOY: Because Ghostbusters II did
poorly?
AYKROYD: Yeah. It opened and Batman
opened the next weekend and wiped us
out that summer. Although we made a
good movie, it just wasn't as commercial-
ly successful as everybody thought it
would be. If I could get that team to-
gether, it would be a real dream, because
I think there's a great story to be told.
But it won't be for a while. By the way, I
heard a great ghost story about an old
Manhattan hotel, the Sheraton, that is
now the Chinese consulate on 42nd
Street on the West Side. We were shoot-
ing on the fifth floor in a banquet room.
I was outside having a smoke and I saw
this guy go down the hall in an Air Force
jacket with master sergeant stripes. I
asked him what was up. He told me he
was an electronic-countermeasures tech-
nician who installs ECM packs on F-16s
and F-106s and all that. He told me that
his father worked in the building and
then he mentioned, "We can't keep
guards." When I asked what he meant,
he said they had gone through five secu-
rity guards. They would come running
downstairs, yelling, "You can keep your
job." They finally questioned one, who
said, "I was making my rounds and I saw
something come through a wall."
  When the man was asked what he had
seen, he said, "It was a man's head and
shoulders. He was wearing red." So this
guy and his dad and brother go up there
to check it out. They were walking on
the fifth floor and they saw something go
across the hall: a guy wearing a red
chef's hat and holding a knife and fork.
They followed him into the kitchen and
he disappeared into the mashed-potato
mixer.
  He said they researched the employee
records of the hotel and found that a
week after it had closed, the roast beef
chef, who had been there for fifteen
years or something, went to a bar
around the corner and drank himself to
death. His presence is still around.
PLAYBOY: Do you believe that story?
AYKROYD: It's a perfect example of a 
ghost story I can place credence in be-
cause it was unsolicited. Now that the
Chinese consulate is there, I've wanted
to talk to someone in charge and ask if
there have been any experiences with
the presence.
PLAYBOY: Have you ever had a personal
experience with a presence?
AYKROYD: My wife and I bought Mama
Cass' old house in Hollywood. It is
where Cream, John Lennon and Harry
Nillson used to hang out. Ringo owned it
for a while. California Dreamin' was re-
hearsed there. We have a presence in
that house. A psychic came in and told us
that some guy apparently died of a drug
overdose in the living room. My wife and
I told a friend of ours about it and he
turned ashen and gasped. He said, "I
