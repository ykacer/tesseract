	Opposite, a fitted gray vest, reminiscent
of a Victorian dandy's (from Kenneth Richards),
is set off by a puff-sleeved blouse from
Callaghan. Instead of the expected black skirt,
this one, from G-Gigli, is plaid flannel, its knot-
ted front a witty play on the bustle.
	As for accessories, beads are a wonderful
way to feminize the crisp lines of menswear;
those opposite are of antique amber from Once
Upon a Time, as is the brooch. Other essentials,
opposite top, include the "Victorian Leaf" vest,
Casleigh; suede gloves, La Crasia; wool scarves,
Etro; garnet necklace, Reema Pachachi at Topper
& Lowell; glasses, Robert Marc Opticians.
	Above: Whether you're going out for a
walk or heading to a dinner party, Linda
Compisano's hat with a paisley ribbon and har-
vest of antique fruit is the perfect topper.
	Right: A look at all the black umbrellas
that came out on a rainy day in Boston in-
spired Anne Gross and her sister Pam to open
Let It Rain, an umbrella company with elegant
designs, like these silk-screened leaves. Jacket,
Laura Ashley.
