		PRE-TERTIARY STRATA

	Pre-Tertiary rocks of the southern Grapevine Mountains comprise
the uppermost part of the thick sequence of Precambrian(?) and Cambrian
strata that is widely exposed in the Death Valley area (Jennings, 1958).
The lower half of the mapped rocks, assigned in ascending order to
the Stirling Quartzite, Wood Canyon Formation, and Zabriskie Quartzite,
is largely of detrital origin, composed mainly of siltstone, mudstone,
and fine sandstone with scattered beds of fine-pebble conglomerate.
Carbonate rocks form most of the upper half of the sequence and are
separated from the detrital rocks by a thin transition zone. The Carrara
Formation includes rocks of the transition zone, whereas the carbonate
rocks are divided into the Bonanza King and Nopah Formations. These
carbonate rocks belong to the eastern, or carbonate, facies recognized
in much of the Paleozoic succession in the eastern and southeastern
Great Basin (Nolan, 1943; Palmer, 1956, among others).
	The pre-Tertiary rocks are described in detail, because their
occurrence in the Grapevine Mountains is the northernmost occurrence
of the Death Valley "facies" on the east side of Death Valley. Know-
ledge of the stratigraphic detail is essential for reconstruction of
facies patterns, or offsets thereof, by major faults in the area
(Stewart, 1967), and for comparisons with the White-Inyo Mountains suc-
cession (Nelson, 1962).
	In the Titus and Titanothere Canyons area, as in most of the
southern Great Basin, the Precambrian-Cambrian stratigraphic sequence
is virtually continuous; no stratigraphic break coincides with the
boundary between the Precambrian and the Cambrian systems. In order to
