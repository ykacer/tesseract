	The correlation coefficient for this analysis is 0.54,
indicating that, although the correlation is significant at the
1 percent level (Crow and others, p. 240), only about 30
percent of the variation in the ratio RK can be accounted for
by variations in clay mineral content. This correlation is
poorer than that determined by Reeve and others (1954, p.
132) for the correlation of the ratio of air- to distilled-water
permeability with exchangeable sodium and cation-ex-
change capacity, probably in part because clay chemistry
