these corrections to the diagram would lower the curve C D E in the im-
mediate vicinity of D, smoothing out the angle at that point, would leave it
unchanged where it intersects the ordinate of 0~, and would carry the point
E farther to the right. It would raise the curve A B at A, and lower it at
B, leaving the central portion unchanged. The point A, or the intersection
with the horizontal axis, would be thrown to the left.
  Fifthly, in the construction of the curves no allowance was made for
evaporation during summer. The curve D E includes only winter evapora-
tion, the curve A B only summer melting. The rate of evaporation for
snow and ice has its maximum at 0~, its law changing at that point. In
the general law for aqueous evaporation, the rate of evaporation is a func-
tion of the difference between the saturation tension corresponding to the
temperature of the evaporated substance and the actual vapor tension of
the evaporating air. Since snow and ice can not rise in temperature above
0~, they can only be evaporated when the aqueous tension of the air in
contact with them is less than the saturation tension for 0~. If it rises above
that, moisture is deposited on the ice as dew, instead of being abstracted
from it. In all but very exceptional cases the range of summer tempera-
tures under which n~~v~~ can evaporate is small-~from 0~ to 5~ or 6~. The
effect of the evaporation is to retard the wasting of the ice, for the energy
consumed by it is deducted from that available for melting, and a unit of
solar heat can melt seven times as much ice as it can evaporate.1 The cor-
rection, if applied to the curve of melting, would slightly increase its upward
concavity.
  Sixthly, the winter evaporation embodied with the winter precipitation
in the curve D E is tacitly assumed to have a rate corresponding to the
mean annual temperature; its rate is really less, being a function of the
mean winter temperature. An error is thus manifestly introduced, and this
error is greatest for the annual temperatures corresponding to short winters.
A corresponding correction of the diagram would raise the line D E by
amounts increasing progressively from D to E.




  1The conditions determining the evaporation of ice and the formation of dew on glaciers are
clearly set forth by Heim, who cites experimental verifications by Dufour and Forel. See "Handbuch
der Gletscherkunde," by Dr. Albrecht Heim, p. 238-241, and Bull. Soc. vaudoise des sc. nat. 1871, pp.
