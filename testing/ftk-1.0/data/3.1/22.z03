They're Pulling Our Leg, Too

BELLA HUSSEY of Kinston, Idaho sent us this lighthearted
photo.  "We were driving along a rural road in Oregon and
spotted this poor fellow sticking out of a large bale," explains
Bella.  "That farm family must have a great sense of humor.
     "But my husband, Fred, went along with the joke and let
me take this picture of him trying to pull the poor guy out.  But
he wasn't able to-~this fellow really gets into his work!"
