V33 is the windspeed at 33 feet

~ depends on terrain roughness at the sta-
  tion site. Terrain categories defined in
  ANSI A58.1-1982 [11] shall be acceptable;
  may also be determined by site-specified
  data analyses.

4.3 Deriving the Extreme Windspeed. The
Fisher-Tippett Type I extreme value distribu-
tion shall be used to obtain the design basis
windspeeds. Typical applications of this approach
have been demonstrated in Simiu Changery and
Filliben [13]. It may be necessary in regions
under the influence of different types of extreme
wind regimes to utilize other statistical distribu-
tions as long as they can be demonstrated to be
more applicable to the site being considered
(Mayne [14]).
