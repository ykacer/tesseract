into Kundelungu beds. Rich ores consist of bornite,
chalcopyrite, galena, and considerable chalcocite
and silver, but no cobalt or gold. Some dissemi-
nated sulfide ores, similar to the Rhodesian ores,
have been developed near Tshinsenda.

Selebi-Pikwe, Botswana. The Selebi-Pikwe ore de-
posits are situated in eastern Botswana, 55 kilo-
meters east of the main rail link connecting South
Africa with Rhodesia, Zambia, and Zaire. The min- 
ing complex includes underground and open pit 
mining operations, concentrator, and a smelter at
the larger Pikwe deposit. The copper-nickel depos-
ists comprise two stratabound sulfide deposits 15
kilometers apart of Archean age situated in the 
highly deformed and metamorphosed gneissic
successions of the Limpopo field belt. Both dissem-
inated and massive sulfides occur in silllike bodies
of amphibolites that are conformable within quartz-




feldspar-biotite-hornblende gneiss. It is suggested 
that the deposits have a syn- or pre-tectonic intru-
sive origin. Post ore folding has resulted in a vari-
able thickness of the ore. Widths range from about 
40 meters to less than 1 meter (Fig. 19-31).
   According to Valentine, the Pikwe ore body
forms an arcuate shape at the surface and has a
strike length of 3300 meters, which reduces below
to 400 meters. The deepest point of intersection of
the ore zone is 370 meters. The deposit can be
divided roughly into three zones: a southern mas-
sive plus 70 percent sulfide zone with grades up to
2.5 percent Ni and 1.5 percent Cu, enclosed in grey
gneisses; a central semimassive 40 to 70 percent 
sulfide zone underlaid with poorly mineralized host
amphibolite; and a northern low-grade 0.8 percent 
nickel and 0.8 percent copper zone of generally
disseminated ore with localized bands of massive 
sulfide distributed throughout the host amphibolite.
