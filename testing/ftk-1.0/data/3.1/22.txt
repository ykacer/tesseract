Woodn't Grant Be Proud?

STRIKING a "Grant Wood pose" in their milking parlor are
Charlette and Alphonse Gauthier of Mohawk, New York.
The similarity and humor of the pose obviously isn't lost on
Al, whose beaming smile is enough to brighten the barn.
     The photo was taken by their daughter Bernadette
Portnoy of Los Angeles, California on her last visit "back
home", and the photo was entered in our Rural Photography
Contest.  The photo didn't win a prize, but both Bernadette
and her parents are Country subscribers, so seeing the pic-
ture published here will likely be prized by all of them.




They're Pulling Our Leg, Too

BELLA HUSSEY of Kinston, Idaho sent us this lighthearted
photo.  "We were driving along a rural road in Oregon and
spotted this poor fellow sticking out of a large bale," explains
Bella.  "That farm family must have a great sense of humor.
     "But my husband, Fred, went along with the joke and let
me take this picture of him trying to pull the poor guy out.  But
he wasn't able to-~this fellow really gets into his work!"




Like Father, Like Son

"OUR 21-month-old son, Ricky, copies everything his dad
does," writes Barbara Paton of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
"So when he saw my husband, Allen, fishing during a vaca-
tion trip, he grabbed an extra rod and decided to try it him-
self," she says.  "I ran for my camera and captured this
memorable photo."
