job as a seamstress keep her busy, but
Carol assured there's always time for
Fresh Corn Salad.  "It tastes best when
you make it ahead and let it sit in the
refrigerator overnight," she said.  "Then
just put it in your picnic cooler and go!"
     Credit goes to her mother, Carol
added, for her entering CW's corn rec-
ipe contest.  "I'd nearly forgotten about
it when Mom reminded me of the ap-
proaching deadline.  I sat right down
and wrote out my entry, never dream-
ing I'd win!"
     Win she did, and soon she and three
guests will be enjoying her Grand Prize
free dinner at a favorite restaurant.
     I can't wait to hear all about it after-
ward.  You might say I'm all ears!  ~~
