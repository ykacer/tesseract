     Your nearest department store may
carry this Corn Butter Dish.  In case it
doesn't, however-~or if you'd simply 
prefer to order by mail-~I've asked our
Country Store to make it available also.
Here's what you need to do to get one:
     Write to Country Store, Suite 3180C,
P.O. Box 990, Greendale WI 53129.
Or call toll-free 1-800/558-1013.  The
cost is $14.98 each (plus $2.50 ship-
ping/handling for the first dish and 50~
s/h for each additional one).  Ask for
item 12302.        -~Mary Beth Jung
