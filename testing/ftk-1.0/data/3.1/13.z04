MUSHROOM MAVENS

Can you imagine our excite-
ment when we discovered a 
store that sells nothing but
mushrooms?  At Aux Delices Des
Bois in New York City, Amy and
Thierry Farges stock a wide variety
of fresh and dried domestic and im-
ported mushrooms.  If you are in the
area you can stop in and talk with
them about their favorite subject, en-
joy the seductive aromas of the dried
and smoked mushrooms, and pur-
chase some of the freshest mush-
rooms in town.  Out-of-towners can
write to the Fargeses for a brochure
at 4 Leonard St., N.Y., N.Y. 10013,
or call (212) 334-1230 for mail or-
ders and unique gift ideas.
     From August 28 to September 25,
mushroom lovers will want to visit
Kennett Square, Pa.-~the "Mush-
room Capital of the World"-~for the
National Mushroom Festival.  This
year's events include a mushroom
farm tour, a recipe cook-off, a mush-
room-picking contest, and more.  For
information, call (800) 932-6369.
