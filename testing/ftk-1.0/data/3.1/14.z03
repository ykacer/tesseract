know about that." It happened just as
the psychic said. It was something that
had been hushed up.
PLAYBOY: You called a psychic?
AYKROYD: We had to. The maid wouldn't
go upstairs. Also, my mother experi-
enced some stuff there and some friends
heard the piano playing and then heard
footsteps and doors closing. When the
psychic said she couldn't deal with it, my
wife went to more traditional methods-~
religion-~to try to get rid of it. But we
think it's still there because recently the
other maid went upstairs and a door
slammed. Another time I was alone in
the house in bed and I felt the mattress
depress behind me like something was
getting into bed. You know what my
reaction was? I didn't hop up. I wiggled
my rump right up next to it. I thought,
If you can like me this much, you're go-
ing to feel me right next to you.
PLAYBOY: Did you believe in ghosts as
a child?
AYKROYD: Of course. They had s~~ances at
the old family farm where I grew up. My
mother witnessed an apparition. I once
saw some lights I couldn't explain. My
father was a psychic researcher, so it was
really passed down to me.
PLAYBOY: It seems Ghostbusters is your
idea of a documentary, not fiction. Are
you pulling our leg?
AYKROYD: Definitely not. The other day
I read that Harold Ramis, my colleague
in Ghostbusters, said he doesn't believe
in ghosts!
PLAYBOY: And that surprises you?
AYKROYD: Yes, because he is a very smart
person. I'm going to bring him up to
Dudley Town, Massachusetts and scare
the shit out of him sometime. I'll take
him to the most haunted place on earth.
He's my man. He's going. I can't believe
he offhandedly says he doesn't believe
in ghosts when it's a reality of life on
this planet. He's going to get spanked
for that.
PLAYBOY: Don't you require more proof
of ghosts than those vague experiences?
AYKROYD: Sure. I'm a skeptic. If some-
body tells me a ghost story, I want proof.
I want to know if he or she was smoking
or drinking. In eighty percent of the cas-
es I've inquired about, you can put a
name to the presence, a human name.
You know why they're there.
PLAYBOY: Why are they there?
AYKROYD: They died in an unfulfilling
and unsatisfied way and they are linger-
ing here in this world for something that
they'll never have. And it's very simple.
Very simple.
PLAYBOY: Frankly, Ramis' view isn't much
of a surprise to us.
AYKROYD: But Harold's such a brilliant
philosopher. He knows that the empiri-
cal scientific world is not all there is.
Maybe that's all he sees. I just can't be-
lieve that he means it. He's such a practi-
cal man, I suppose.
PLAYBOY: Did your experiences with
