  Similar terraces on the coasts of some of the
offshore islands are further evidence of different
amounts of uplift on different structural blocks.
San Clemente Island is terraced practically to its
summit (1,480 feet). Santa Catalina Island has
only a few poorly developed terraces, even
though it lies between San Clemente Island and
the Palos Verdes Hills, both of which are promi-
nently terraced.

		PACIFIC BORDER PROVINCE

  GREAT VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. The Great Val-
ley of California, situated between the Sierra
Nevada and the Coast Ranges, is a structural
trough-~part of a Tertiary and Quaternary geo-
syncline. In the south, where the structural depth
is greatest, Tertiary and younger formations bury
the granitic batholith and its roof rocks to a
depth of at least 3 miles. The axis of the trough
is near the western edge of the Great Valley,
where the base of the geosynclinal sediments has
not been reached by even the deepest drill holes.
Most of the sedimentary deposits were derived
by erosion of the Sierra Nevada; the youngest
form long, low alluvial fans that slope westward
from the foot of the Sierra. The sedimentary
formations in the trough, are richly petroliferous,
especially toward the south, and some of Cali-
fornia's principal oil fields are producing from
them.
