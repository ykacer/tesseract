Like Father, Like Son

"OUR 21-month-old son, Ricky, copies everything his dad
does," writes Barbara Paton of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
"So when he saw my husband, Allen, fishing during a vaca-
tion trip, he grabbed an extra rod and decided to try it him-
self," she says.  "I ran for my camera and captured this
memorable photo."
