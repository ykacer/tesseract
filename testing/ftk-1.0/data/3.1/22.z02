Woodn't Grant Be Proud?

STRIKING a "Grant Wood pose" in their milking parlor are
Charlette and Alphonse Gauthier of Mohawk, New York.
The similarity and humor of the pose obviously isn't lost on
Al, whose beaming smile is enough to brighten the barn.
     The photo was taken by their daughter Bernadette
Portnoy of Los Angeles, California on her last visit "back
home", and the photo was entered in our Rural Photography
Contest.  The photo didn't win a prize, but both Bernadette
and her parents are Country subscribers, so seeing the pic-
ture published here will likely be prized by all of them.
