PUMICEOUS
PYROCLASTIC-FLOW
DEPOSITS

  Pyroclastic flows are high-velocity surface flows of
high-temperature fragmental material. Such flows
potentially are very destructive because of their high
temperatures and great mobility. Historic flows have
been observed to travel a few kilometers from vents
at velocities of up to 60 m/s, and analyses of
prehistoric deposits suggest that large flows can cover
distances of as much as 100 km at velocities of up to
200 m/s.
  Pyroclastic flows are commonly subdivided on the
basis of constituent materials and grain size into ash
flows, pumice flows, lithic pyroclastic flows, block-
and-ash flows, and so on. Ash flows consist chiefly of
ash-sized particles of glass shards and phenocrysts;
the term pumice flow is applied if pumice lapilli and
blocks are dominant. Ash flows are a common type
of pyroclastic flow, especially in large-volume erup-
tions. Block-and-ash flows contain abundant, large,
little-vesiculated fragments and commonly form by
explosive disruption or gravitational failure of the
flank of a growing lava dome. Many pyroclastic
flows are preceded by a ground-hugging hurricane-
like surge cloud and accompanied by an overriding
ash cloud, each of which may result in recognizable
deposits.
  Pumiceous pyroclastic flows of mafic dacite occur-
red during six major 1980 eruptions at Mount St.
Helens (May 18, May 25, June 12, July 22, August 7,
and October 16-18). This sequence presented excep-
tional opportunities to observe and photograph
pyroclastic flows in motion, study their primary
depositional features, measure thermal and rheolog-
ical properties, relate size and sorting parameters to
eruption characteristics, and monitor compositional
changes. In general, time intervals between successive
pyroclastic eruptions increased during 1980, and
