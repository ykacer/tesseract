the band asked if we would license them
the name so they could tour. Judy and I
said, "Go for it"; we get a small percent-
age of the take. I go out and play the
harp sometimes. We do Soul Man and
Knock on Wood. We rip the house apart.
PLAYBOY: How do you rate your musical
abilities?
AYKROYD: I'm a great emcee-front man
and I can move onstage. It's funny and
exciting to see a man of two hundred-
plus pounds moving in such a way that it
looks like he knows reasonably well
where he's going and he's not going to
hurt people.
PLAYBOY: What are your musical tastes
these days?
AYKROYD: I listen a lot. My favorites are
the Black Crowes, Robert Cray, Bonnie
Raitt, Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughan,
Kim Wilson and the Thunderbirds.
There's also a new band called Blues
Traveler with an amazing new young
harmonica player named John Popper.
PLAYBOY: Might there be another Blues
Brothers movie?
AYKROYD: I'm working on a story with
John Landis, who directed the original.
We're going to try to bring back every-
body from the first movie. We have to
convince the studio. The walls of Univer-
sal are still stained from the first Blues
Brothers movie.
PLAYBOY: Stained? Didn't Universal
make money on that?
AYKROYD: Not really, because it cost so
much. They made their money back, but
it was traumatic getting the movie made.
It was an enormous production. John
was out of control.
PLAYBOY: You've often been criticized for
creating movies with runaway budgets.
AYKROYD: We are always criticized for
costs-~for 1941, Ghostbusters, Blues Broth-
ers-~but that money doesn't go into the
pockets of the actors and directors, it
goes into the pockets of labor.
PLAYBOY: And special effects and
wrecked cars....
AYKROYD: The major expense of Blues
Brothers was not the seventy police cars
we bought from the Chicago Police De-
partment. We paid only $700 each for
them. The major expense was labor, so
that's good, it gets people working, and
why shouldn't the profits of the mega-
corporations be reinvested in the trades
of this industry? If I write a big show and
it costs a lot of money, I make no apolo-
gies. I'd be a wealthier man today and a
better businessman if I sat down and
wrote small movies that cost little and
brought in lots.
PLAYBOY: Will you continue to make se-
quels-~whether based on the Blues
Brothers, Ghostbusters, Coneheads or
others?
AYKROYD: As long as there is something
new to do with them and it's enjoyable.
It's kind of nice to have built-in franchis-
es. The one I don't think we'll necessari-
ly further exploit is Ghostbusters. It looks
