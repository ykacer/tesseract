Tatoosh Pluton at Mount Rainier, the Snoqualmie
Pluton to the north, and the Cloudy Pass batho-
lith at Glacier Peak, are middle Tertiary. The
older, which include the Colville, Osoyoos,
Similkameen and Chelan plutons (Fig. 18.20) or
batholiths, are late Mesozoic.

	LOWER CALIFORNIA (PENINSULAR
		RANGE) PROVINCE

  The Lower California Province, situated be-
tween the Salton Trough and the coast, is the
northern end of Baja California. The province is
a batholith of granite that, in part at least, is of
Cretaceous age, intrusive into Lower Cretaceous
formations and overlain by younger, Upper Cre-
taceous ones. The granite forms a westward-
tilted plateau, the east front of which is a tre-
mendous east-facing escarpment, like the east
front of the Sierra Nevada. San Jacinto Peak at
the north end is more than 11,000 feet in altitude
and overlooks Salton Trough, which extends
below sea level. Northwest-trending faults ex-
tend obliquely across the escarpment and divide
it into a series of northwest-trending mountains.
  Along the coast are wave-cut marine terraces
of Pleistocene age (Fig. 18.21). These terraces,
some of which are as much as 1,300 feet above
sea level, record a series of Pleistocene uplifts.
The terraces are warped, for the uplift was irreg-
ular.
