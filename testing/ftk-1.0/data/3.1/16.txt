needed to achieve consistency with American
National Standard Building Code Requirements
for Minimum Design Loads in Buildings and
Other Structures, ANSI A58.1-1982 [11].

Depending on site topography, water bodies, and
meteorological conditions, the site representative
extreme windspeeds may be simply interpolated
values between distributions derived from ex-
isting wind station data. For sites located in
complex terrain, physical modeling may be used
to relate wind data available at an existing wind
station to expected wind characteristics at a
proposed site (Cermak [12]).

4.2 Winds at a Standard Level. The anemometer
height above ground varies from wind station to
wind station and may vary from time to time at
the same station. Thus, it is necessary to extra-
polate or interpolate the wind data to a standard
height. The standard height shall be 33 ft (10 m).
The extrapolation shall be done by the power law:




where

V33 is the windspeed at 33 feet
Vz is the measured windspeed at height z
   above the ground in feet
~ depends on terrain roughness at the sta-
  tion site. Terrain categories defined in
  ANSI A58.1-1982 [11] shall be acceptable;
  may also be determined by site-specified
  data analyses.

4.3 Deriving the Extreme Windspeed. The
Fisher-Tippett Type I extreme value distribu-
tion shall be used to obtain the design basis
windspeeds. Typical applications of this approach
have been demonstrated in Simiu Changery and
Filliben [13]. It may be necessary in regions
under the influence of different types of extreme
wind regimes to utilize other statistical distribu-
tions as long as they can be demonstrated to be
more applicable to the site being considered
(Mayne [14]).
