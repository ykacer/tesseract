eruptive volumes, vesicularity, and degree of
chemical differentiation decreased.
  Pyroclastic flows were first observed shortly after
noon on May 18; resulting deposits extend as much as
8 km from the vent, cover an area of about 15 km2,
and have a bulk volume of about 0.2 km3 (Rowley
and others). The deposits form a fan-like pattern of
sheets, tongues, and lobes of mostly poorly sorted
ash and clasts of pumice and dense dacite. Succes-
sively younger 1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits, in gen-
eral, cover progressively smaller areas and have
smaller volumes. The flows formed along with devel-
opment of large vertical ash columns. Most pyro-
clastic flows originated when bulbous masses of ash,
lapilli, and blocks rose only a short distance above
the inner crater before spreading laterally to the
north, but some flows were observed to result from
gravitational collapse of parts of an accompanying
vertical ash column.
  Morphologic and rheologic measurements on pyro-
clastic-flow deposits of July 22 and August 7 indicate
that the flows moved as non-Newtonian fluids, most
readily modelled as Bingham plastics (Wilson and
Head). Reverse grading of coarse, low-density
pumice clasts in marginal levee deposits is interpreted
as the consequence of briefly increased fluidization,
related to interaction between the flow and surround-
ing air at the time of emplacement.
  Petrographic and textural studies indicate that all
1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits consist mainly of
juvenile dacite, containing plagioclase, hypersthene,
hornblende, and Fe-Ti-oxide phenocrysts in a vesic-
ular glassy matrix (Kuntz and others). In general, suc-
cessively younger deposits show increasing modal
proportions of plagioclase, hypersthene, and Fe-Ti-
oxide phenocrysts, increasing average anorthite con-
tent of plagioclase, increasing phenocryst:glass ratios,
and decreasing porosity. These relations suggest that
successive eruptions have tapped deeper levels in a
compositionally zoned magma chamber, have pro-
gressively depleted the magma of volatiles, and have
been characterized by decreased amounts of vesicula-
tion and gas thrust.
