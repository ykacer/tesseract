	1Sample numbers are those of the Hydrologic Laboratory, U.S. Geological Survey, Lakewood,
Colo. Samples in the 70 Tex series were obtained at the Lubbock Airport Spreading Site, those
numbered 71 Tex 98-107 are from a site near Caprock, Tex., and those numbered 71 Tex 155-174 are
from a site near Stanton, Tex.
	2Depth is to the top of the 0.15-meter drive core from which the sample was taken for analysis. A
lowercase a or b after the sample number indicates that two samples were analyzed from that core.
	3As measured at the prevailing moisture content.
	4Samples from the Lubbock and Caprock sites were tested using water from a well tapping the
Ogallala Formation at the Lubbock Airport site, and those from the Stanton site were tested using
water from a well near that site.
	5RK is the ratio of hydraulic conductivity as determined by the air-permeability measurments to
that measured using water, and is the same as the ratio of intrinsic permeability that would be
determined by use of the two fluids.
	6As a decimal fraction of the total mineral content. These fractions, which are approximate, were
determined by Barbara Anderson of the Hydrologic Laboratory, U.S. Geological Survey,
Lakewood, Colo.
	7These samples are both from the clay bed at approximately 27 m in depth at the Lubbock Airport
Spreading Site.
