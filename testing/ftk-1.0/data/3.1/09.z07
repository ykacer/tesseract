To apply equation 9, the arithmetic average clay content was
determined from data on all of the samples collected and
tested from a given layer. This average value was used to
represent CMC in the equation. Use of the arithmetic
average was arbitrary, and may not be completely ap-
propriate because it assigns too little weight to the effects of
wetting on the discrete clay layers within each interval.
However, the worth of the correction for the effects of
wetting would be questionable no matter what averaging
scheme was used.
	Results of applying equation 9 to compute corrected
hydraulic conductivities are listed in table 4. The results
appear reasonable for the top two layers, but not for the
bottom four layers. Moreover, the apparent agreement
between the corrected air-permeability results and the
recharge-based hydraulic conductivity for the surface layer
may be fortuitous. The surface layer probably is indeed more
sensitive to the effects of wetting than the deeper layers, as
described above. However, the laboratory-based correction
factor was determined on samples mainly collected at depth,
and thus is not necessarily relevant for the surface layer data.
Agreement of the corrected air-permeability-based
hydraulic conductivity with the recharge-based value for the
8-15-meter layer also seems fortuitous, as the massive caliche
in this zone should not be structurally affected by wetting.
	Failure of the correction scheme to improve the
air-permeability-based hydraulic conductivity estimates for
the bottom four layers may result from flow occurring
through secondary porosity features, such as cracks and
joints, rather than through the intergranular porosity. Thus
the laboratory results, which include effects of wetting on
permeability related to intergranular porosity only, might
not be relevant.
	Additional experience with the air-permeability technique
will be needed to reconcile whether, or under what con-
ditions, a correction for the effects of wetting is warranted
for layers at depth. On the other hand, sufficient experience
has been gained to indicate that Ke values of the near-surface
materials generally would need to be corrected for the effects
of wetting. Such a correction could be practically developed
if the ratio of air-permeability-based to recharge-based
hydraulic conductivity could be correlated with some readily
measurable property of the near-surface materials.
