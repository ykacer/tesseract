EVERYBODY likes to spread a pat or
two of butter on a steaming ear of corn
on the cob.  But butter inside the ear?
     That's the fun behind this bright new
butter dish I recently came across-~it's
shaped and colored just like a nice fresh
ear of sweet corn straight off the stalk!
     It added lots of laughter to our CW
kitchen during testing for the corn rec-
ipe contest.  And it will do the same for
your summer get-togethers...and, for
that matter, meals all year long.
     There's no fooling when it comes to
the quality of this dish, however.  Made
of glazed pottery, it retains its vibrant
green and yellow colors through many
