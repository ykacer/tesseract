How to Be
an Eskimo

 by Mariette Hartley, Encino, California
      as told to Richard H. Schneider




  Years ago, in a group-therapy
  session, I heard a story that I
  have never forgotten. It en-
lightened me to how a Higher Power
works in our lives. It went like this:
  "Hey, Father," said a man talking
to a priest. "You got it all wrong about
this God stuff. He doesn't exist. I
oughta know."
  "Why's that, my son?"
  "Well, when I was ice-fishing in
the Arctic far from the nearest village,
a blizzard blew up with wind and
blinding snow. I was a goner. So I got
down on my knees and prayed real
hard, begging God for help."
  "And did He help you?"
  "Heck no. God didn't lift a finger.
Some Eskimo appeared out of no-
where and showed me the way."
  It took me a while to recognize the
Eskimos in my life. And I had needed
them so desperately.
  I grew up haunted by my maternal
grandfather, John B. Watson, a fa-
mous psychologist who founded a
movement called behaviorism. It
taught parents to resist their chil-




dren's natural bonding needs, which
he considered undesirable. There
was to be no cuddling, no kissing, few
outward signs of affection. As a result
of this kind of treatment as a child,
my mother later learned to use alco-
hol to numb her feelings of isolation.
And my father, a high-powered ad-
vertising executive, also succumbed
to alcohol. Despite their affliction,
they loved me deeply. I grew up with
my younger brother in affluent Wes-
ton, Connecticut, where I discovered
my calling. At 11 I joined the Silver
Nutmeg Theatre Company with roles
in plays like Alice in Wonderland and
Little Women in elementary schools
around the state.
  Smitten by the theater, I met one
of my first Eskimos, Eva Le Galli-
enne, the legendary actress, who was
teaching at the White Barn Theatre
nearby. Miss Le G. was a small, de-
lightful woman with a tiny nose, vio-
let eyes and translucent skin. She
wore lavender cashmere sweaters
and periwinkle-blue dresses. A loving,
giving person, she taught youngsters




like me as well as professionals. I
learned so much from her-~how to
feel and project emotions, and to let
"the sacred fire strike" by eliminating
self so that the character one is play-
ing shines through.
  Miss Le G. also inspired me spiri-
tually. Though Mom and Dad were
not religious, I was attracted to
church. Sunday mornings I'd hop on
my bicycle and pedal to the Norfield
Congregational Church, where I sang
solos in the choir. My early days in a
dysfunctional family were traumatic,
to be sure, but it was in church that I
was reminded of hope and goodness.
  The power and abundance of that
hope became very clear to me one
beautiful summer afternoon when I
was 16 and just back from a rehearsal
at a nearby Shakespeare festival. I
was walking in a field, and as I
stopped by a tree I suddenly had an




overwhelming spiritual
experience. In a family
of atheists, it was hard
to share these feelings,
and I was lucky enough
to be able to tell Miss Le
G. in a letter. She wrote
back from London that
she too had had a simi-
lar experience, that
there were "times, alas,
when I felt so utterly un-
deserving that I was
filled with a kind of won-
dering humbleness, not
just humility, but the
sort of thing that flings
you to your knees. Try
terribly hard not to fail
it," she continued, "al-




ways be yourself . . . never get
conceited or spoiled . . . keep
brave, keep strong, do the job
at hand to the best of your
ability . . . know that you are




being used by some greater Power
and try to obey it."
  It was my belief in a spiritual life
that sustained me through the diffi-
cult years to come. As a teenager I
suffered a short-lived marriage to an
older man who beat me mercilessly.
Later I was offered a leading role in
the film Come Fly With Me, but a doc-
tor misdiagnosed my hepatitis. With-
out proper treatment, I got too sick to
take the role.
  Then, most devastating of all, was
my father's suicide. It happened after
Dad, tormented by alcohol, had lost
job after job and succumbed to hope-
lessness. Mother and I were eating
lunch when a gunshot rang out from
the bedroom. We dashed in to find he
had shot himself in the head. For a
year I kept hearing that gunshot and
was barely able to work at all.
  Finally, after fighting my own al-
