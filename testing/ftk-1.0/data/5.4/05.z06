   The employees at Kuempel
   Chime Clock Works and Stu-
   dio in Excelsior, Minn., are
   any business owner's dream.
They get to work early. They're
self-starters. They rarely get sick.
They are meticulous about quality.
They are honest. And they work
hard.
   The secret? They are older
workers. Old, in fact. According to
Bruce J. Hedblom, principal owner
of the company, most of Kuempel's
20 employees are ages 62 to 84.
   Throughout its 77-year history,
says Hedblom, an owner since
1990, Kuempel has "targeted the
older worker as the ideal em-
ployee." The company prepares
kits for grandfather clocks and
smaller clocks that customers as-
semble and finish themselves.
   In an era when other companies
are downsizing by pushing older
employees out the door or luring
them out with attractive retire-
ment packages, Kuempel and a
handful of other smaller companies
are steadfast about maintaining a
work force of seniors.
   "Their work ethics are unbeliev-
able. They're from the old school,
the school of hard knocks. They're
just great people," says Millie
Newman, an owner of The Place, a
discount clothing chain based in
North Miami.
   The Place has hired older work-
ers since its founding 28 years ago
because they can relate to the
company's target customers, who
are age 40 and over. Now the
company has four stores in south
Florida, and 63 of its 74 employees
are 60 or over. Newman is 73.
   "It is the policy of The Place to
hire, not fire, the senior citizen,"
says Richard Walfish, Newman's
son and partner.
   Business owners like Hedblom,
Newman, and Walfish emphasize
that their employees disprove the
myths about older workers. Such
misperceptions arise on various
subjects. Among them:

   Absenteeism.  "For the most
part, our employees are in good
health, and we certainly don't have
