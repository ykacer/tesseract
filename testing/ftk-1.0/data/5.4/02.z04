~ Pale hair color made
skin look washed-out.
~ Her too-thick hair was
dry and damaged.

Changing Marian's hair
color to dark blonde 
immediately warmed up 
her skin tone.  To get her
heavy hair under control,
we clipped off six inches
of damaged locks, blunt-
cut the bottom and added
long layers around her
face.  Ivory foundation,
camel and rust eye
shadow, and apricot
blush continued the
warming trend.
