Thieves wheely like convertibles

  Car thieves prefer ragtops.
  And the convertibles of
choice last year for the dis-
criminating crook were the
Volkswagen Cabriolet and
Ford Mustang, according to
figures compiled by the High-
way Loss Data Institute.
  At the bottom of the list of
cars from 1991 to 1993 was
the unlovely and -~ happily
-~ unwanted Chevrolet Cava-
lier station wagon.
  The Virginia-based re-




search agency came up with
the list by compiling 1993 in-
surance claims filed with 15
major companies.
  Researchers also found




that:
~ Car-theft claims were
made almost twice as often in
large metropolitan areas as
in the rest of the country. De-




troit led the nation with 21.5
claims per 1,000 insured ve-
hicles.
~ Anti-theft devices that ac-
tually incapacitate cars, like
GM's computer PASS-key sys-
tem, deter car thieves.
~ The number of theft claims
for newer cars last year hit a
new low, but insurance com-
panies paid more per claim
than ever before.
  New York's car thieves
don't follow national norms,
though, according to police
figures. They prefer older,
boxier~cars. With News Wire Service
