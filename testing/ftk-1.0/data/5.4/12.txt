REGION IN BRIEF

Deputized Indians patrol sacred site

  Treasure hunters have been looting ancient American Indian
burial grounds at Moccasin Bend for 50 years, but the sacred site
near Chattanooga, Tenn., now has some home-grown protection.




  Thirteen mem-
bers of the Chatta-
nooga InterTribal
Association -~ after
receiving training
from the county
sheriff's depart-
ment, the district at-
torney's office and
the FBI -~ have
joined a newly
formed sheriff's re-
serve force and be-
gun regular armed
patrols of the 6.4-
square-mile site.




  Evidence of civilization dating back 12,000 years has been
found at Moccasin Bend, but grave robbers have plundered up to
1,100 graves since the site was rediscovered a half-century ago.
"The ground looks like where artillery has come in, the gravedig-
gers have made so many holes," says Bob Welch, a Cherokee mem-
ber of the new patrol.

~ A PLACE IN THE SUN: Florida nudists, concerned about
gawkers at the beach, have worked out a deal with federal park
rangers for privacy at Canaveral National Seashore. Park offi-
cials had distributed fliers saying clothing is optional all along the
24-mile stretch of beach, but the nudists objected. A revised flier
will state that nudists generally congregate in areas beyond the
paved roads at Playalinda and Apollo beaches. The arrest of nud-
ists at the park last year led to a court ruling that public nudity in
Florida is allowed unless it is for lewd or lascivious reasons.

~ A HOUSE DIVIDED: Richard O'Hara and son Shawn have at
least one thing in common: Each wants Mississippi Republican
Trent Lott out of the U.S. Senate. Richard, 77, is running against
Lott in the June 7 GOP primary. Shawn, 36, an evangelist, is run-
ning for the Democratic nomination and a chance to face Lott in
November.... Alabama state Sen. Hank Sanders (D-Selma) and
his law partner, J.L. Chestnut, have both signed up to run for San-
ders's seat, but there's no animosity between the two. Chestnut got
into the race because of talk that local Democrats may dump Sand-
ers from the ballot to punish him for supporting independent can-
didates in local races.
