MANAGING




Golden Employees-~
In Their Golden Years




Small businesses are
discovering that older
workers are often "aged to
perfection."




By Sharon Nelton




   The employees at Kuempel
   Chime Clock Works and Stu-
   dio in Excelsior, Minn., are
   any business owner's dream.
They get to work early. They're
self-starters. They rarely get sick.
They are meticulous about quality.
They are honest. And they work
hard.
   The secret? They are older
workers. Old, in fact. According to
Bruce J. Hedblom, principal owner
of the company, most of Kuempel's
20 employees are ages 62 to 84.
   Throughout its 77-year history,
says Hedblom, an owner since
1990, Kuempel has "targeted the
older worker as the ideal em-
ployee." The company prepares
kits for grandfather clocks and
smaller clocks that customers as-
semble and finish themselves.
   In an era when other companies
are downsizing by pushing older
employees out the door or luring
them out with attractive retire-
ment packages, Kuempel and a
handful of other smaller companies
are steadfast about maintaining a
work force of seniors.
   "Their work ethics are unbeliev-
able. They're from the old school,
the school of hard knocks. They're
just great people," says Millie
Newman, an owner of The Place, a
discount clothing chain based in
North Miami.
   The Place has hired older work-
ers since its founding 28 years ago
because they can relate to the
company's target customers, who
are age 40 and over. Now the
company has four stores in south
Florida, and 63 of its 74 employees
are 60 or over. Newman is 73.
   "It is the policy of The Place to
hire, not fire, the senior citizen,"
says Richard Walfish, Newman's
son and partner.
   Business owners like Hedblom,
Newman, and Walfish emphasize
that their employees disprove the
myths about older workers. Such
misperceptions arise on various
subjects. Among them:

   Absenteeism.  "For the most
part, our employees are in good
health, and we certainly don't have




any absentee problems that would
be out of line with the normal
population," says Hedblom.
  The U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services says older
workers who stay in the labor force
may represent a self-selected
healthier group of older people.
  "They take good care of them-
selves. We don't see many bleary
eyes around here," laughs John H.
Swon, one of Hedblom's partners.

  Learning. Business owners and
managers find seniors no more
resistant to learning than younger
workers. "They're scared of com-
puter equipment," says April
Tripp, a department manager at
Enrich International, a multilevel
marketing firm in Orem, Utah.
"[But] that's very easily overcome
with practice."
  Kuempel's employees include a
retired school principal, a former
banker, and others who were hired
with no experience in woodwork-
ing or clock repair. They've
learned those skills on the job.

  Benefits. While the costs of
benefits such as health, disability,
and life insurance often do increase
with an employee's age, such bene-
fits may not be a factor when an
employee reaches 65. According to
research conducted for the U.S.




"The ideal employee" is how older workers such as Harry
Carlson, 83, left, are viewed by Bruce J. Hedblom's clock
company, in Excelsior, Minn.




Older Workers, Younger Bosses




To April Tripp, an older worker is anyone 40
or over. But then, she's only 25.
  As a manager at Enrich International, a
marketer of herbal and beauty products, in
Orem, Utah, Tripp supervises 30 people;
usually four or five are in the "older"
category. "It can be a little difficult when I
am the same age as [an employee's] youngest
child," she says.
  Any young supervisor could be mindful of
these observations about older workers:
  ~ Don't be afraid to hire them. "As long as
you treat them fairly with the other employ-
ees and don't show them any more or any less 
deference than you show anyone else, it can




be a real productive experience," Tripp says.
  ~ Regard older workers as a valuable
resource. They offer experience and special
qualities, says Joan Kelly of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
  ~ Don't be intimidated. Some older work-
ers think their age qualifies them for higher
pay, Tripp has found, but she's firm about not
favoring any age group with higher pay.
  ~ Deal with resentment tactfully. Some-
times an older worker resents a younger
boss. A tactic that has worked for Tripp is to
put the employee in charge of a special
project, which often makes the worker too
busy to be resentful.  -~Sharon Nelton
