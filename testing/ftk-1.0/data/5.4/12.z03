  Evidence of civilization dating back 12,000 years has been
found at Moccasin Bend, but grave robbers have plundered up to
1,100 graves since the site was rediscovered a half-century ago.
"The ground looks like where artillery has come in, the gravedig-
gers have made so many holes," says Bob Welch, a Cherokee mem-
ber of the new patrol.

~ A PLACE IN THE SUN: Florida nudists, concerned about
gawkers at the beach, have worked out a deal with federal park
rangers for privacy at Canaveral National Seashore. Park offi-
cials had distributed fliers saying clothing is optional all along the
24-mile stretch of beach, but the nudists objected. A revised flier
will state that nudists generally congregate in areas beyond the
paved roads at Playalinda and Apollo beaches. The arrest of nud-
ists at the park last year led to a court ruling that public nudity in
Florida is allowed unless it is for lewd or lascivious reasons.

~ A HOUSE DIVIDED: Richard O'Hara and son Shawn have at
least one thing in common: Each wants Mississippi Republican
Trent Lott out of the U.S. Senate. Richard, 77, is running against
Lott in the June 7 GOP primary. Shawn, 36, an evangelist, is run-
ning for the Democratic nomination and a chance to face Lott in
November.... Alabama state Sen. Hank Sanders (D-Selma) and
his law partner, J.L. Chestnut, have both signed up to run for San-
ders's seat, but there's no animosity between the two. Chestnut got
into the race because of talk that local Democrats may dump Sand-
ers from the ballot to punish him for supporting independent can-
didates in local races.
