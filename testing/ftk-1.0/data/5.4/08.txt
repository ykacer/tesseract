THE BEST of EVERYTHING




you can't eat compliments," Charlie Brown's dog Snoopy
once groaned, but maybe he was just peeved because Lucy
gets more fan mail than he does. The truth is, you can eat
compliments -~ they fortify the soul, nourish the spirit, and best
of all, there's no expiration date on the label.
  To civilians (people who claim they don't have time to watch
soaps; meanwhile, they've got their nose buried in some trashy ro-
mance novel), all soaps look the same. You and I know better. Wake
us in the middle of the night, and we can tell you instantly the dif-
ference between a BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL fashion show (it's
flashier), an ANOTHER WORLD cocktail hour (it's feistier) and
a GUIDING LIGHT garden party (it's funnier).
  Every show has some unique element -~ some spark of magic
-~ that lifts it above the rest. So, let's toast those elements with a
few words and a big pat on the back. As the Great Philosopher Bea-
gle also said, talk is cheap, but "a hug is better than all the theol-
ogy in the world."
