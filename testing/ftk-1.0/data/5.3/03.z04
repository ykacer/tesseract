  "This is a new day," Cisneros de-
clared, vowing that if necessary he
would summon federal marshals to
protect future black tenants.
  Cisneros and his assistant secre-
tary for fair housing, Roberta Ach-
tenberg, won praise from civil rights
groups for conceding that racial dis-
crimination within the public housing
system is rampant. By contrast, dur-
ing the Bush and Reagan years,
HUD denied bias in dozens of court
battles. The agency is now likely to
settle most of those suits, Achten-
berg said.
  In other areas, such as fixing up
its public housing and fostering eco-
nomic development in poor neigh-
borhoods, critics say HUD is a long
way from offering solutions.
  Last week, Cisneros outlined re-
forms designed to eliminate or con-
solidate 59 HUD programs. He also
vowed to let local housing officials
use modernization funds to replace
run-down public housing units with
new units - a financing tool that
could rid the country of some of its
worst public housing high-rises.
  Cisneros has also committed
himself to continuing former HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp's program to
sell public housing units to tenants.
But in many developments, HUD is
still a slumlord. At the same time
families may wait years for a public
housing unit or a rent subsidy. In
1993, HUD had only 10.6 million
units to meet the needs of an esti-
mated 14.3 million people.
  Michael Kane, director of the
Boston HUD Tenant Alliance, is
skeptical of the plan to decentralize
HUD - a pet idea of Cisneros'. "The
career bureaucracy is not going to
change," Kane said.
  Yet in an interview Cisneros in-
sisted that "reinventing HUD is very
real." He grabbed a a pen and
sketched a pyramid representing the
distribution of the agency's 13,500
employees. Then he turned the
sketch upside down to show how
power would shift to workers in the
field.
