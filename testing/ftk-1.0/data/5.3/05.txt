Eat this book
Trying to find something decent to eat in
your basic college cafeteria is, at best, a
challenge. Green leafies are tired and gray,
there are no clues to the mystery meat, and
you're consumed by the awful realization
that food just isn't what it used to be.
  Taste buds take note. Tray Gourmet: Be
Your Own Chef in the College Cafeteria
(Lake Isle Press, $10.95) is the book you'll
hanker to digest. The concept is simple:
Use what you've got, make good choices,
and be creative. Our favorite recipe is
devoted to multiculturalizing that dining
hall staple, tuna fish. Start with a serving
of plain, unadorned tuna ("Dead White
Male Tuna," according to Tray), add a
handful of chopped apples, some raisins,
some onion, a little curry powder, and




voil~~! You
have Indian
Tuna. For no-
fuss Favorite
Fettuccine Al-
fredo, take
plain pasta
(any shape will
do), and add
various spoon-
fuls, handfuls,
and shakes of
cheese, sour
cream, butter,




milk, and pepper. Let the microwave do
the blending. As long as you're up for a lit-
tle mixing, a little melting, you can be your
own chef. And there's no need to worry
about getting it all exactly right. After all,
you can't possibly make cafeteria food any
worse than it already is. -~Susan Swimmer

UPPER-CLASS LIFE

The problem with PC
Being politically correct-~PC-~at
college is more than simply having
"correct" political views. It con-
notes a certain attitude-~a
consciousness. PC was originally
supposed to ensure that students
in diverse college communities were sensi-
tive to ethnic differences and used nondis-
criminatory and inoffensive language. All
good intentions. But being PC isn't just
about the language you use. It's the clothes
you buy, the music you listen to, and every-
thing you read. It's the difference between
Andrew Dice Clay and Jerry Seinfeld.
  My college, Brown University, in Provi-




dence, Rhode Island, is an ac-




tivist place where subtle
pressure to be politically cor-




rect pervades student




life. I'm happy to be
at a school where
students take over




University Hall to demand need-
blind admissions or sleep in shanty




towns on The Green in solidarity
with the homeless, and I defi-




nitely prefer action to apathy.
But sometimes I feel like it's




impossible to be apolitical at my school-~it's
as if there's one way to think and feel about
a million different issues, and when I don't
agree with the accepted point of view, or I
don't have any opinion on an issue, I'm some
reactionary pig.
  In my freshman year at Brown, I pretty
much followed along with the PC herd. I re-
cycled, I bought a Brown mug to use instead
of Styrofoam cups, I even came to love those
Guatemalan sweaters that you can so conve-
niently purchase at the Brown Post Office.




Even though I went to a




fairly liberal all-girls
high school in New ~
