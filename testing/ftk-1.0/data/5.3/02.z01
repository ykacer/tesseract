M-1 Costs Rise

THE COST of
obtaining gov-
ernment rifles
used by Legion
Posts' color and
honor guards has tripled in
recent months to more than
$150 per rifle for shipping
and handling. The ceremo-
nial rifles are loaned free to
Posts by the government
arsenal at Anniston, Ala.
Posts must pay shipping and
handling fees. As recently
as six months ago, a WWII-
era, .30-caliber M-1 Garand
rifle cost Posts about $50
each in these fees.
  Army officials blamed the
increases on personnel and
budget cutbacks. They are
aware that many Posts can-
not afford the $150 price tag
and are looking for ways to
lower the price, if possible.
  As prescribed by the
Legion's Manual of Cere-
monies, Posts must send
their requests for rifles and
blank ammunition to: Exec-
utive Director, The Ameri-
can Legion Washington
Office, 1608 K St., Wash-
ington, DC 20006.	~
