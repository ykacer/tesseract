independent front and rear suspension, electron-
ic damping, and speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion
steering. These underpinnings allow Cadillac en-
gineers to pull off a real sleight-of-hand: In spite
of its size, the Concours handles like a true
sports sedan, with precise steering and road feel
and an isolated yet controlled ride. It's fast and
it sticks to the road, with none of the soft, wal-
lowing sensations of Cadillac's past efforts.
  Two details keep the Concours out of the true
sports sedan class: Instead of front bucket seats
and a console, there's a bench seat for three
passengers in front, a feature Cadillac says its
buyers demand. And the instrument cluster is
digital, with no analog display available.
