 LEAN CAT LICKS NO~

  Wider use of fuel-efficient lean-
  burn engines has been
  stymied by a major problem:
oxides of nitrogen (NO~) emissions. As
fuel mixtures get leaner, exhaust gas-
es become oxygen-rich. Excess oxygen
makes it difficult for current catalysts
to deoxidize NO~. For carmakers with
lean-burn engines, an effective NO~
catalyst has been the Holy Grail.
  Mazda claims to have found it-~at
least a version adequate for the
Japanese market. The company re-
cently announced a three-way catalyst
that removes hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from
lean-burn engine exhaust.
  The catalyst is based on the mineral
zeolite, which is coated with a precious
metal Mazda won't identify. The com-
pany says it has confirmed the durabil-
ity of the new catalyst in bench tests.
  For drivers, the benefit is fuel effi-
ciency. The Mazda catalyst allows
lean-burn operation over a wider range
of driving conditions than current lean-
burn engines, boosting fuel economy
from 5 percent to 8 percent.
  The new catalyst does not yet meet
California's strict NO~ limits, however.
