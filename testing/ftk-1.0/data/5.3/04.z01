Instant divorce
law struck down

An Associated Press Report

  NEW DELHI, India -~ A
court has struck down a law
that lets Muslim men in India
divorce their wives by re-
peating a single word, ruling
that the centuries-old tradi-
tion is unconstitutional and
denigrates women.
  The order by the Allah-
abad High Court in the north-
ern state of Uttar Pradesh
was the first legal setback to
the Muslim tradition allowing
men to divorce by saying,
"Talaq, talaq, talaq," which
means divorce in Arabic.
  There are no nationwide
figures, but clerics say most
divorces among India's 100
million Muslims occur this
way.
  The ruling Friday came
in a case brought by a di-
vorced Muslim woman in a
property dispute. It was a
boost to India's growing Mus-
lim feminist movement,
which will likely press on
with its demand for changes
in divorce laws.
