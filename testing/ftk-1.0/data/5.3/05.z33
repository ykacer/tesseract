impossible to be apolitical at my school-~it's
as if there's one way to think and feel about
a million different issues, and when I don't
agree with the accepted point of view, or I
don't have any opinion on an issue, I'm some
reactionary pig.
  In my freshman year at Brown, I pretty
much followed along with the PC herd. I re-
cycled, I bought a Brown mug to use instead
of Styrofoam cups, I even came to love those
Guatemalan sweaters that you can so conve-
niently purchase at the Brown Post Office.
