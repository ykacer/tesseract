  WASHINGTON - Henry Cis-
neros likes dramatic gestures.
  When a homeless woman died
outside the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, the HUD
secretary appeared at her funeral.
When the Ku Klux Klan threatened
black residents of a Texas housing
project, Cisneros seized control of
the local housing authority to force
integration. When an earthquake hit
Los Angeles, Cisneros dashed to the
scene and stayed for two weeks.
  No one is saying the drama is
meaningless. Even Cisneros' harsh-
est critics, who accuse him of show-
manship for political gain, concede
that the 46-year-old former mayor of
San Antonio seems to mean well.
But, by most accounts, what he has
accomplished in a little over a year
still falls far short of his goals.
  Cisneros says it is too early to
judge him. His critics are skeptical
that he will ever live up to his goals -
in part because his approach is
sometimes inefficient and in part be-
cause his aims are so ambitious as to
be unachievable.
  Consider Cisneros' reaction
when he walks by a panhandler.
Against the advice of experts, Cis-
neros conceded in a recent interview,
he reaches into his pocket for
change.
  "I know that some may be using
that for alcohol or other substance
abuse," Cisneros said. "But if I can
help others, then I don't mind."
  Cisneros has set reducing the
number of homeless people on the
streets as his top priority. He reels
off his five lesser priorities: improve
public housing, expand opportunities
for private housing,  combat housing
discrimination, empower poor com-
munities to develop economically
and reform HUD's management
style.
  In the Clinton Cabinet, Cisneros
has taken the role of champion of the
underdog, which critics argue has let
other Cabinet members off the hook
too easily. His colleagues respect his
