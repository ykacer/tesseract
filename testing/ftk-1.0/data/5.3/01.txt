FAMILY AMUSEMENTS




A vacationing family can spend a small fortune visiting amusement parks, so it pays to plan ahead and to look into discounts.
Every amusement park in the country has a posted admission charge, but often those prices can be beaten through discount
offers and local-sponsor deals.  To find out more, call the park directly.  The following full-fare prices are for one-day admis-
sion.  These parks are the top 10, based on 1992 attendance.                                              -~ Tim O'Brien
