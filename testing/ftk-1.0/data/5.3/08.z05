ONE THING THAT HELPS KEEP A COM-
pany on the empowerment track is a
statement of the company's philosophy
or vision. It should be simple enough
that employees and managers alike can
easily understand it and refer to it, says
Anna VerSteeg, president of Compet-
itive Solutions, a consulting firm spe-
cializing in empowerment strategy,
who warns that some companies' state-
ments are so long that they gather dust:
"A vision should inspire and motivate
people, such as `Through our people,
achieve and be the best we can be,' or
even `Beat Coke,' which is undoubted-
ly Pepsi's vision." The Scanlon Plan
was developed during the 1940s and
'50s by Joe Scanlon, a researcher with
the United Steelworkers of America,
who later taught his worker-produc-
tivity theories at MIT. The plan, used
by Boston's Beth Israel Hospital and
Landscape Forms of Kalamazoo,
Mich., has four principles:
1. Identity. Everyone in the company
must understand the business, its goals
and the need for profitability.
2. Participation. Everyone in the
company must have the opportunity to
influence decisions.
3. Competence. Each person must
continually improve his or her abilities.
4. Equity. Returns should be shared
with employees, investors and cus-
tomers. Each must get a fair return.
