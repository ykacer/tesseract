  At just less than 11 feet long, the
car had no parking problems in New
York. And it magically swallowed a
six-foot-tall test driver and a six-foot-
three-inch photographer. Getting in
and out of the car, however, required
the agility of a gymnast.
  A worthy road warrior? You bet. But
one you won't soon see in midtown
rush hour traffic.-~Sandy Fritz
