making process, either in small teams or
individually," says Jeanette Headrick, a 51-
year-old who joined Collins ~ Aikman six
years ago, just when the troubles had come
to a head. Headrick, now coordinator of the
carpet-installation department, gives credit
for the company's success to the empow-
erment-training program facilitated by
Pecos River Learning Centers of Santa Fe,
N.M., and Executive Quality Management
of Spartanburg, S.C. During the two-day
program, Headrick and her colleagues par-
ticipated in a series of exercises, such as
scaling a 42-foot wall in groups of three
linked together with rope, much as their
fates within the company would be linked.
Teammates on the ground held belay ropes
and told their climbers where to place their
feet and hands. For Headrick, a perfec-
tionist, the wall was a Waterloo: "I had to
make a decision, after talking to my team-
mates, that I was not able to climb the wall.
They had to come down with me, so it kept
them from climbing it, too." In the end, she
says, she and her teammates learned how
to work much more harmoniously. "Every-
one has their own wall, and you learn to be
more tolerant," she explains.
  As a result of programs like this one,
floor-coverings-division employees have,
over the last two years, suggested over
1,800 ways to change procedures, pro-
cesses and products. Roughly 75 percent
of their ideas have been adopted. One
team of employees reduced the waste
from cutting carpet into tiles by 90 per-
cent. All facets of quality have improved.
The division has won four awards for
excellence in design from the Institute of
Business Designers.
  Morale has also improved. Employee
turnover fell from 27 percent in 1989 to 14
percent last year. And absenteeism
declined from 3.4 to 2 percent, the indus-
try average, in spite of the fact that
employees are encouraged to take time off
when they need it, rather than penalized
for missing work.
  Unlike Collins ~ Aikman Textile
Group, spurred by crisis, the Taylor group
of companies moved to participative man-
agement out of foresight. James Taylor,
president and CEO, and his brother John,
treasurer, are third-generation managers
of the boat-accessories subsidiary, Nelson
A. Taylor, based in Gloversville, N.Y., that
their grandfather started in 1908. The par-
ent company employs over 500 people in
six plants scattered about the U.S., Ireland
