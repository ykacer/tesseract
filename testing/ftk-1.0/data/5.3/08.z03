get in the way," says 49-year-old James,
whose tone lets you know he has tripped
over his own ego more times than he
cares to count."You have to change your-
self," says John, 42. "The organization is
only a reflection of the people. So if all
the people believe in top-down manage-
ment, the organization is top-down." Like
Eitel, the Taylors learned early on that
empowerment cannot coexist with fear.
James realized he would have to learn to
shut up when he heard, during an early
self-management meeting, that some of his
people had coined the word "Jimidation."
  Initially, it was as hard for the workers
to take responsibility as it was for the Tay-
lors to relinquish it. "The first team we ever
formed was one to come up with new work
rules," says James. After a few weeks, sev-
eral workers told him to write the rules him-
self. All that's changing now. Workers at
each plant have written new rules for work
and compensation, and some teams even do
the hiring. The human-resources depart-
ment supports them by administering ben-
efits and assisting in locating candidates to
hire. And the managers have become coach-
es. Says John, "One job is to outline certain
legal and ethical parameters things have to
be within, and to measure everything we
do against the needs of our customers."
  Without empowerment, says James,
Nelson A. Taylor would very likely have
sunk last year, when the industry's rev-
enues fell by nearly half from '89. But the
company rode out the storm.

CAR WARS  The most widely noted
American empowerment success is also at
one of the biggest companies that adhere
to this ideology-~General Motors. Not
long ago, few experts would have predict-
ed that an all-new American car could
have matched the reliability of Toyotas
and Hondas. But for the second year in a
row, GM's Saturn has done just that,
according to the current annual auto issue
of Consumer Reports.
  Some credit must go to the Saturn
plant's managers, who from the start
were determined to build the best Amer-
ican car ever. But credit must go also to
workers-~and empowerment. Mercedes
Benz's 300 and 190 series, veritable
tapestries of fine engineering, are signif-
icantly less reliable than Saturn, says
Consumer Reports. But then, Daimler-
Benz, the manufacturer, is not perceived
to be as empowered or as lean as Saturn.
