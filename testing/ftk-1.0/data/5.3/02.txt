M-1 Costs Rise

THE COST of
obtaining gov-
ernment rifles
used by Legion
Posts' color and
honor guards has tripled in
recent months to more than
$150 per rifle for shipping
and handling. The ceremo-
nial rifles are loaned free to
Posts by the government
arsenal at Anniston, Ala.
Posts must pay shipping and
handling fees. As recently
as six months ago, a WWII-
era, .30-caliber M-1 Garand
rifle cost Posts about $50
each in these fees.
  Army officials blamed the
increases on personnel and
budget cutbacks. They are
aware that many Posts can-
not afford the $150 price tag
and are looking for ways to
lower the price, if possible.
  As prescribed by the
Legion's Manual of Cere-
monies, Posts must send
their requests for rifles and
blank ammunition to: Exec-
utive Director, The Ameri-
can Legion Washington
Office, 1608 K St., Wash-
ington, DC 20006.	~

Invocation Before Pledge In New Meeting Order




TO MORE precisely reflect the Legion's
creed, "For God and Country," the invo-
cation has been moved ahead of the Pledge
of Allegiance in all Legion meetings. Dur-
ing the Spring Meeting in May, the Nation-




al Executive Committee passed Res. 24,
which states meetings will begin in the fol-
lowing order: Call to Order, Salute to Col-
ors, Invocation, Pledge of Allegiance and
the Preamble.				~




VIDEO OPPOSES GAYS IN MILITARY




IN A new video,
Our Military
Under Siege,
National Com-
mander Roger
A. Munson and other mili-
tary experts speak out
against lifting the ban on
homosexuals in the U.S.
Armed Forces. Produced by
the Defense Readiness
Foundation, the 35-minute
video outlines the many
problems that will arise if
the ban against homosexu-
als in the military is lifted.
  In his video appearance,
Munson explains that the




Congress, not the President,
is responsible for making
the rules and regulations
governing the military.
"This video would be
appropriate for Legion
meetings or to give to local
cable access channels,"
Munson says.
  For a copy of the video,
