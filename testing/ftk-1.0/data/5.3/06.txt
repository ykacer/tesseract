No, this is not a trick photo. Microcars start small, and in their sporty derivatives, get even smaller.
The tiny size is prompted by Japanese regulations aimed at saving space.




       MICROCARS

 URBAN ASSAULT VEHICLE

  Before you even ask, the answer is
  no. No, you cannot buy the new
  660-cc, DOHC, three-cylinder, in-
tercooled, turbocharged Mazda AZ-1
in the United States, even if you could
afford its $14,000 sticker price. The
plastic-bodied, bumperless micro-rock-
et would never meet U.S. crash safety
requirements, and tweaking its 64-
horsepower engine to pass our emis-
sions standards would erode the AZ-1's
40-mpg rating. But that didn't stop us
from throwing the mid-engine coupe
into Manhattan traffic to judge the
Japanese definition of an urban
assault vehicle.
  City vehicles need to accelerate
quickly, stop quickly, and feature good
mirrors. The AZ-1 scored well in all
three departments. Acceleration off
stop lights was brilliant, especially
when the turbo kicked in with a
scream at around 3,000 rpm. Four-
wheel disc brakes quickly checked the
1,587-pound car's excess speed and
the mirrors gave an ample view of the
New York traffic around us. Steering
was nimble and sure. Japan-market
city cars are, in some ways, an urban
commuter's dream.
  The AZ-1 failed on two key points,
however. Potholes ingested its little
13-inch wheels and strained the four-
wheel independent suspension; also,
the car's cute appearance and gull-
wing doors drew crowds anywhere it
was parked. That suggests it would
also attract thieves.




  At just less than 11 feet long, the
car had no parking problems in New
York. And it magically swallowed a
six-foot-tall test driver and a six-foot-
three-inch photographer. Getting in
and out of the car, however, required
the agility of a gymnast.
  A worthy road warrior? You bet. But
one you won't soon see in midtown
rush hour traffic.-~Sandy Fritz




     EMISSIONS

 LEAN CAT LICKS NO~

  Wider use of fuel-efficient lean-
  burn engines has been
  stymied by a major problem:
oxides of nitrogen (NO~) emissions. As
fuel mixtures get leaner, exhaust gas-
es become oxygen-rich. Excess oxygen
makes it difficult for current catalysts
to deoxidize NO~. For carmakers with
lean-burn engines, an effective NO~
catalyst has been the Holy Grail.
  Mazda claims to have found it-~at
least a version adequate for the
Japanese market. The company re-
cently announced a three-way catalyst
that removes hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from
lean-burn engine exhaust.
  The catalyst is based on the mineral
zeolite, which is coated with a precious
metal Mazda won't identify. The com-
pany says it has confirmed the durabil-
ity of the new catalyst in bench tests.
  For drivers, the benefit is fuel effi-
ciency. The Mazda catalyst allows
lean-burn operation over a wider range
of driving conditions than current lean-
burn engines, boosting fuel economy
from 5 percent to 8 percent.
  The new catalyst does not yet meet
California's strict NO~ limits, however.

PREVIEW DRIVE




   CADILLAC'S
   NEW CRUISER

  It's big, make no mistake about it. At 210
  inches long and 3,998 pounds, Cadillac's
  Deville Concours, new for 1994, is three
inches longer and 400 pounds heavier than
last year's Deville.
  The new Deville has most of the hallmarks of
the typical large American luxury cruiser. But not
quite all. Installed beneath this Caddy's broad
hood is the Northstar V8 engine, until now of-
fered only in the Seville and Eldorado Coupe
and the discontinued Allant~~. This variant of
Cadillac's double-overhead-cam, 32-valve en-
gine develops 270 hp at 5,600 rpm and 300
pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm; sufficient,




says Cadillac, to push the six-passenger
sedan to 60 mph in about eight




seconds.
  Concours has the




rest of the
Northstar
"system"
as well,
including




independent front and rear suspension, electron-
ic damping, and speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion
steering. These underpinnings allow Cadillac en-
gineers to pull off a real sleight-of-hand: In spite
of its size, the Concours handles like a true
sports sedan, with precise steering and road feel
and an isolated yet controlled ride. It's fast and
it sticks to the road, with none of the soft, wal-
lowing sensations of Cadillac's past efforts.
  Two details keep the Concours out of the true
sports sedan class: Instead of front bucket seats
and a console, there's a bench seat for three
passengers in front, a feature Cadillac says its
buyers demand. And the instrument cluster is
digital, with no analog display available.
