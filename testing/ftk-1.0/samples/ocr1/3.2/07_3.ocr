BUSINESS BUZZ

competitors or suppliers are permitted
to join the group; confidentiality is guar-
anteed by mutual secret sharing-there
are no signed agreements.
  TEC provides its nearly 3,000 mem-
bers, most of whom work in the U.S.,
with access to other bosses just like them,
all grappling with the same problems. And
at an annual fee of $8,400, it's far less
expensive than the typical $i,ooo-a-day
rate for private consultants. Aside from
the meetings, executives also have the ben-
efit of monthly one-on-one consultations
with group leaders. Membership has in-
creased tenfold over the past decade; still,
just 142 members are women.
  Barbara Ainley, CEO of L.A. Studios,
a $7-million-a-year company that pro-
duces sound effects for commercials,
says her TEC group helped her restruc-
ture her business. A year ago, her man-
agers simply were not getting the job
done. "Nobody was taking responsibili-
ty," she says. "Everything was being
dumped in my lap." Ainley could have
fired the lot, but her group convinced
her that it would be better to train them
instead. She linked compensation to stu-
dio hours billed, instituted a system that
ties management bonuses to specific per-
formance goals and started an annual em-
ployee survey in which management is
graded-all to good effect. "You might
call it business therapy," she concedes.
"But even if there's nothing wrong with
your company, there's always a way to
do things better."   -Elliot Pinsley
