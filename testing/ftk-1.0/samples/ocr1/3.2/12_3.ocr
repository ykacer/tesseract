by the subscript r (r = 1, 2,. . . , j, and ~ refers to the relative reaction rate of
the rth reactant mineral with respect to the ~th (HELGESON, 1968; HELGESON,
GARRELS and MACKENZIE, 1969). With this notation we can now represent the
grand matrix equations by a single expression; i.e.

A matrix equation of this form can be constructed for the reaction coefficients as well
as for each of their successive derivatives. However, only two such matrices are norm-
ally required for accurate mass transfer calculations. The following definitions apply
to all of the matrix equations:

and

The remaining elements of the first matrix equation are defined by

and

The remaining elements of the second matrix equation are given by
