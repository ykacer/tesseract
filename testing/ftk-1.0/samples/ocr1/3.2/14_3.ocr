Figure 189. -Lower surfaces of dead fir leaves from sites 1
and 2 in the seared zone (see fig. 185). Wax plug (wp) in
stomatal antechamber pore (ap) seems intact in leaf from
site 1 (A), but only wax plug remnants (rm) remain on leaf
from site 2 (B). Cuticle of rim (r) of antechamber pore and
ribbing (rb) appears glazed in leaf from site 1 (A), and
outlines of guard cells (gc) are apparent in some stomata
on leaf from site 2 (B).

eruption was greater than 500C, hot enough to result
in leaf death. However, volcanic 502 or droplets of
H2S04 may also have played a role in causing leaf
death. Site 1 was closer to the volcanic crater, was
higher in elevation, and was subjected to tempera-
tures nearly 2000C cooler than site 2. Although hot
ejecta were deposited on site 1, this site was at the
southern margin of the eruption cloud and it is in-
ferred from this study that the air temperatures re-
mained relatively cool. Site 2 was 2,400 m lower in
elevation than the crater and 21 km away, but it was
in one main path of the directed blast. The higher air
temperatures at site 2 may have resulted from heated
air, which was trapped and carried between hot ash
particles that were falling and flowing downhill.
Analyses of leaves from additional sites (fig. 185) may
provide further insight into the temperature patterns
in the seared zone of the blast area. These estimates
would be of geological interest and could reveal pat-
terns of heat dispersion from the eruption of May 18,
1980.
