For- example,  lOCFR96O.4-2-l(d)   states that  `~ site shall  be dis-

qualified   if the pre-waste-emplacement ground-water travel      time

from the disturbed    zone to the accessible environment    is

expected   to be less than  1,000 years   along any pathway of   likely

and  significant   radionuclide travel."


1.1.2 Relationship    to Site Characterization Plan


       The proposed  study is needed  in part  to fulfil  information

need   1.17.2 -- Potential  Effects of Future Climatic Conditions

on Hydrologic Characteristics,     and it is specifically requested

under study   1.17.2.1   -- Characterization of the Quaternary

Regional   Hydrology as activity   1.17.2.1.6 -- Studies of Calcite-

Opaline Silica Vein Deposits.      Some of the data obtained during

this study will    fulfil  part of information need   1.20.2 -- Nature

and Rate of   Tectonic Processes,    Including Faulting,  Folding,

Uplift and Subsidence,     and Seismic Activity.


1.1.3 Relation to other programmatic requirements


       A NRC memo of Jan 16,   1986 by John Bradbury and Charlotte

Abrams notes that the origin of the calcite and opaline silica

deposit of Trench     14 "will have direct bearing on the suitabil-

ity of   the site for burial   of HLW'.   Representatives of the NRC

and the State of Nevada expressed concerns about the origin of

the deposit at workshops held in Las Vegas, Nevada on Feb.        28,

and April    28, 1986.   At the April meeting, representatives of
