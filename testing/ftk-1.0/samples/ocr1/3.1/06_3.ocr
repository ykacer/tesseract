            Under reducing   conditions   (up  to Eh =  O.27-O.O6pH),  a  reduction
            to metallic   Tc(s)   is feasible.   Dominating  species   in solution
            would be TcO(OH)2,    and possibly   also TcO~   at  low pH and highly
            reducing conditions    (Eh < 0.2-0.O6pH),    Fig.  la.

            Under mildly   reducing   conditions  (Eh > O.27-O.O6pH)   the  solubi-
            lity  limiting  phase   would  be TcO2(s),   with  TcO(OH)2   as  domi-
            nating soluble species    up to Eh     0.5-0.O6pH,   Fig.  lb.


            The heptavalent    state  (TcO4) would dominate at Eh > 0.5-0.O6pH,
            still with TcO2(s)    as solubility   limiting phase.


            The  total solubility    under  highly  reducing   conditions would  be
            as low as  1O~ M or below     (less  than ~ig/l) and would  increase to
            10~-10~ M     (mg/l-level)  with   increasing  Eh  (Cf.  Fig.  2). This
            concentration,   which   would  be constant  at  Eh  between  0.27 and
            0.45  V,  is  related  to the   choice  of  solubility   product  for
            TcO2(s)   and should  be  considered   as a  maximum value.   By  using
            log  K  = -31,  which   was previously   suggested   (2),  instead of
                  5
            log  K    -28.9  (Table  1) which   is an assessed maximum value,    the
                  5
            resulting  total   technetium   solubility   at  Eh  between  0.27 and

            0.45  V would  be  less than  106 M.


            At Eh above   0.45-0.50   V the  solubility  is  increasing   up  to at
            least 101 ~io2 M,     which would   be the  solubility   limit set by a
            MTcO4(s)-species, assuming a     concentration of monovalent cations
             +
            M  of 0.1 M   (;/l-level).  This  could possibly be achieved      in very
            saline waters,   but  rarely under groundwater conditions.


4           CONCLUSIONS


            The  following  conclusions   can be made  concerning    the solubility
            of technetium   in natural  waters,   particularly deep groundwaters.


            o Under highly   reducing conditions    the  s&ubility can    be  as low
              as  10~ M   or below;   a reduction   to elementary    technetium  is
              feasible.
