Rutgers begins training of workers to pass on job safety

Effort with Industrial Union Council
funded by $1.2 million state grant

      By DONALD WARS HAW
    A two-year program designed to
geometrically  expand     health and
safety training of the state's private
sector workforce opened yesterday on
the Rutgers University campus in New
Brunswick.
    The effort to "Train the Trainers"
to then train other workers is spon'-
sored jointly by the Rutgers Institute
of Management and Labor Relations
and the state Industrial Union Council
IIUC), whose   affiliated locals rep-
resent around 200,000 members in
New Jersey.
    The  training is being     funded
through a $1.2 million grant under the
state's Workforce Development Part-
nership Act of 1992 administered by
the state Department of Labor.
    Assembly    Labor     Committee
Chairman Patrick Roma (R-Bergen),
the program's   chief sponsor,  and
Labor Commissioner Peter J. Calde-
rone joined TUC leaders and Rutgers
officials at the initial session held at
the Rutgers Labor Education Center.
    "The act marked the first time
New Jersey has a stable source of
funding for occupational safety and
health," Roma told around 80 union

members from 16 international unions
and a handful of corporate representa-
tives attending the initial session.
   "He alth and safety is the lifeblood
of working people," IUC President
Archer Cole observed, in praising the
program and urging the establishment

yesterday to inform their employers
about the program and seek their par-
ticipation.
   Roma said that with some 10,000
workers killed on the job each year and
60,000 more fatalities as a result of oc-
cupational diseases that "claim 2,000
lives along each year in New Jersey,"
greater attention to worker heaith and
safety is a must.
   He  said studies have demon-
strated those companies adopting co-
operative programs not only better

protect their workers, but also enjoy
greater productivity and profitability,
adding he too favored worker-manage-
ment committees.
   These committees, Roma said,
are called for under legislation before
Congress to reform the federal Occu-

pational Safety and Health Act.
   "I will ask the Assembly to join
with me in memorializing Congress to
enact OSHA reform," Roma said.
   Calderone said an April meeting
of the Governor's Safety Committee
attracted 700 persons from the private

`Health and safety
are the lifeblood of
working people.'
