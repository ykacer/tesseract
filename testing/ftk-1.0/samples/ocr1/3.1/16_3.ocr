De~e~ding on mite topography, water bodies, and
meteorological conditions, the site representative
extreme windapeeds may be simply interpolated
values between distributions derived from ex-
isting wind station data. For sites located in
complex terrain, physical modeling may be used
to relate wind data available at an existing wind
station to expected wind characteristics at a
proposed site (Cermak 1121).

4.2 Winds at a Standard LeveL The anemometer
height above ground varies from wind station to
wind station and may vry from time to time at
the same station. Thus, it is necessary to extra-
polate or interpolate the wind data to a standard
height. The standard height shall be 33 ft (10 in).
The extrapolation shall be done by the power law

where

  V~a is the wi.ndspeed at 33 feet
  V~ is the measured windapeed at height z
     above the ground in feet
  u  depends on terrain roughness at the sta-
     tion site. Terrain categories defined in
     ANSI A58.1-1982 [11] shall be acceptable
     may also be determined by aite-speciZed
     data analyses.
4.3 Deriving the Extreme Wandipeed. The
Fisher-Tippett Type I extreme value distribu-
tion shall be used to obtain the design basis
windipeeds. Typical applications of this approach
have been demonstrated in Simiu Changery and
Filliben (131. It may be necessary in regions
under the influence of different types of extreme
wind regimes to utilize other statistical distribu-
tions as long as they can be demonstrated to be
more applicable to the site being considered
(Mayne 1141).
