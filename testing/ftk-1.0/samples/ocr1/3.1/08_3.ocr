Expressway Ramps Closed

 The roar of the jackhammers
continues on both the Kennedy
and  Stevenson expressways. On
the Kennedy reconstruction, the
outbound exit ramp at North Aye-

nue will close
Monday,    fol-
lowed  by the
Fullerton exit
on  Wednes-
day. The good
news: The Di-
versey Avenue
slip ramp has
reopened, pro-
viding   easier
access to  the
express  lanes.

On the Stevenson, the outbound
Damen  Avenue off-ramp shut
down Friday and will be closed
until the Monday morning rush.
Traffic on the Stevenson remains

reduced to two lanes in each di-
rect ion  between the Dan   Ryan
and the Tn-State Toliway. In the
Loop, crews painting the CTA L
structure  will  reduce lanes on
Lake Street between Wells and
Wabash.    Elsewhere downtown,
viaduct   work   has closed Lake
Street    to all traffic between
Wacker and Canal. Viaduct work
has reduced Washington to four
lanes between Canal and Clinton.
