that make an our/it uniquely yours. Fortunately,
this season fashion designers are taking their
cues from 19th-century novels and creating riches
that will last Victoria readers for many seasons.
    Opposite, afitted gray vest, reminiscent
of a Victorian dandy's (from Kenneth Richards),
is set off by a puff-sleeved blouse from
Callaghan. Instead of the expected black skirt,
this one,from G-Giglz, isplaidfiannel, its knot-
ted front a witty play on the bustle.
    As for accessories, beads are a wonderful
way to feminize the crisp lines of menswear;
those opposite are of antique amber from Once
Upon a Time, as is the brooch. Other essentials,
opposite top, include the "Victorian Leaf" vest,
Casleigh; suede gloves, La Crasia, wool scarves,
Etro, garnet necklace, Reema Pachachi at Topper
& Lowell; glasses, Robert Marc Opticians.
    Above: Whether you're going out for a
walk or heading to a dinner party, Linda
Compisano `s hat with a paisley ribbon and har-
vest of antique fruit is the perfect topper
    Right. A look at all the black umbrellas
that came out on a rainy day in Boston in-
spired Anne Gross and her sister Pam to open
Let It Rain, an umbrella company with elegant
designs, like these silk-screened leaves. Jacket,
