                       PRE-TERTIARY STRATA


         Pro-Tertiary rocks of the southern Grapevine Mountains C0i~tl5S

the uppermoSt part of the thick sequence of Precambriafl(?) and Cambrian

strata that is widely exposed in the Death Valley area (Jennings,  1958).

The lower half of the mapped rocks, assigned in ascending ardor to

the Stirling Quartzite, Wood Canyon Formation, and Zabriskie Quartzlte,

is largely of detrital origin, coriposed mainly of slltstone, mudstofl@,

and fine sandstone with scattered beds of fine-pebble conglomerate.

Carbonate rocks form .w~t of the upper half of the sequence and are

separated from the detrltal rocks by a thin transition zone.   The Carrara

Formation includes rocks of the transition zone, whereas the carbonate

rocks are divided into the Bonanza King and Nopah Formations.  These

carbonate rocks belong to the eastern, or carbonate, fades recognized

in much of the Paleozoic succession in the eastern and southeastern

Great Basin (Nolan, 1943; Palmer, :956, among others).

         The pro-Tertiary rocks are described in detaIl, because their

occurrence in the Grapevine Mountains is the northernmost occurrence

of the Death Valley "fades" on the east side of Death Valley.    Know-

ledge of the stratigraphic detail is essential for reconstruction of

fades patterns, or offsets thereof, by major faults in the area

(Stewart, 1967), and for coriparisons with the White-inyo Mountains suc-

cession (Nelson, 1962).

         In the Titus and Titanothere Canyons area, as In most of the

southern Great Basin, the Precambrian-Cambrian stratigraphic sequence

is virtually continuous; no stratigraphic break coincides wIth the

boundary between the Precambrian and the Cambrian systee's.  In ardor to
