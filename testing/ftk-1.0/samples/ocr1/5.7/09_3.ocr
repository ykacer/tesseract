   SAN JOSE, Calif. - Jimmy Delgado
 got his gang tattoos to tell the world
 who he was. He wants to get rid of
 thqm because of who he wants to be.
   ~he distinctive marks him    off pro-
 spective employers, threatening the
 life he plans away from the street.
   "I stopped trying to look for a job."
I Delgado said.  `Even if I'm dressed
 nice .. . they don't want to hear what
 I have to say."
   The 17-year-old former member of
 the Patinas gang doesn't plan on hav-
 ing the palm-tree tattoo on his neck
 much longer.
   lie is among about 100 youths ex-
 pected to take advantage of a new city
 program under which a plastic sur-
 geon will remove gang tattoos for free.
   "A gang tattoo not only says some-
 thing about your past, it can rob you
 of your dreams for tomorrow and
 can damage a young person's self-
 image," Mayor Susan Hammer said
 recently in announcing the program.
   Removing tattoos by surgery or by
 laser can cost several thousand dol-
 lars. But Dr. Josh Korman, who has
 traveled to poor countries to repair
 cleft palales and do other reconstrtlc-
 tive surgery, is donating his services.
   "I think this wilt give people an
 opportunity to get back into the
 woi-kforce," he said.
   The treatment will be at Forest
 Surgery Center, which is waiving
 most of its fee. The city is contribut-
 ing SIS,000 to cover some of the ex-
 penses and the rental of a laser.
   John Lawrence, 18, plans to take
 advantage of the offer. Lawrence a
 former gang member, is back in
 school, working   toward      his high
 school  equivalency   diploma,    and
 wants to learn various trades.
   lie plans to cover up the tattoos on
 his arms. But he wants to remove a
 large "Good Times Bad Times" tattoo
 on his neck, a group of dots on his
 cheek and "Turtle" - his old gang
 name - from above his left eyebrow.
   "When you put on a tattoo, you're
 advertising who you are and where
 you're from," he said.
   At first, he said, "it's fun....You
 don't see all the bad parts. I just got
 Aired, man. You can't be looking be-
 hind your back forever.
