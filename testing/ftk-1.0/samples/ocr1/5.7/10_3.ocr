Dear George:

It is time once again for Saint Cloud Hospital     to replicate  its bi-annual
consumer research study.    As the  incumbent, we surely would like to again
consider you as a candidate to complete the study.      I would appreciate you
providing to me at your earliest convenience,     a proposal  on behalf of your
firm to do a consumer telephone survey.     The survey will   consist of a
sample size of 600 with roughly the same survey length as we have
previously done and in approximately the same geographical      service area.

Assuming your firm is   interested,  I look forward to receiving your
proposal.   Thank you for your consideration.

Si~cerely,

Roge~b B. `bberg       I
