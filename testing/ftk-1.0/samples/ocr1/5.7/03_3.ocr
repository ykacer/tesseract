gave them unpleasant off-tastes: Most
tasted slightly salty, biller, and astrin-
gent, and left a metallic aftertaste. It's
possible, however, that those flaws
would not be noticed by someone
drinking on the run.

R.ommendations
 For most exercisers, the physio-
logical benefits of sports drinks are
no greater than those of many other
beverages. Your only serious con-

cern should be fluid replacement
Sports drinks will do no more for you
in that regard than water, the choice
of many professionals.
 If you're a serious athlete-some-
one who engages in strenuous exer-
cise for more than one hour at a
time, or who works out moderately
for two hours or more-a sports
drink may provide the fluid you
need with  carbohydrates in the
best concentration. But so will di-

luted fruit juice, which costs less.
 It is possible, as Gatorade claims,
that sports drinks may taste better
than other beverages when you're
hot and sweaty (they don't when
you re not). And the salt in sports
drinks may help keep you thirsty and
make it easier to keep drinking. But
if sports drinks are not to your taste,
they'll do you no good. You need to
choose a drink you enjoy; the more
you like it, the more you'll drink.  U

the results are listed together for each
product. Except as noted, all were slightly
to moderately sweet, were moderately
