B68                    GENERAL GEOLOGY OF DEATH VALLEY, CALITORY~IA

3 mm thick and about 30 mm long; an occasional one
may be 40 mm long and only 1 mm thick.       They are
hollow tubes, and many contain a drop or so of water.
Most of them lean or are bent in the direction of the last
strong wind.
 Another feature of the flood plains is the salt pools
which develop where the water table is shallow enough
to dissolve through the salt crust, giving rise to struc-
tures collapsed into the underlying pool for the most
part of salt-saturated water (fig. 37).  They are most
abundant and best developed 5~ miles northwest of
Badwater, around the north end of the massive rock salt.

 In general, the content of malts in the brines in Death
Valley increases panward, is greater in ground water
than in surface water, greater in dry years than in wet
years, and greater in standing water than in running
water.  The increase in salts panward is due both to
evaporation of water and to re-solution of salts.  Semi-
quantitative chemical analyses of the brines are given
in tables 50-52.
 The effect of the several variables on the composition
of the brines is illustrated by a series of graphs (figs.
38-50) representing suites of samples along ground-
water and surface-drainage courses into the pan.
 Differences in major constituents along a 5-mile
stretch of Salt Creek where it enters the pan are iUus-
trated on figure 38.  This graph illustrates the increase
in total salts panward and the increase in sodium and
potassium relative to calcium and magnesium.        Car-
bonates were not determined in these brine samples, but
other analyses (table 34) indicate that along one stretch
of Salt Creek there is about a fifth as much bicarbonate

as sulfate.  No doubt the proportion of carbonate
decreases panward, as do calcium and magnesium.

 A series of samples along a 3,000-foot traverse into
the northeast corner of Cottonball Basin, in the Salt
Springs area, is illustrated on figure 39.  This graph
illustrates the panward increase in salts, but it also
shows that the ground water is more saline than surface
water at the same position in the pan.    Later tests in
this same area indicate that the uppermost layer of
the ground water is more saline than deeper layers.
In February 1958, a few days after a rain, the uppermost
ground water, 3-4 inches below the surface, contained
4.3 percent dissolved solids, whereas ground water
bailed from 3~ feet contained only 2.5 percent.
 Springs used as a source of domestic water supplies
in the Furnace Creek area are located along faults on
the fans north of Furnace Creek Wash.       Four major
sources are Travertine and Nevares Springs,      and
springs in the bluffs near Cow Creek.  Analyses of the
waters are given in table 35, page B73.
 The springs at Cow Creek probably are fed by
ground water underfiow from the Nevares Springs;
the other springs are warm springs, and probably the
high temperatures are due to circulation at no great
depth but through warm rocks. The thermal gradient
in the ground in this highly faulted area probably is
higher than average, and an increase of only 300F
over the annual average temperature would heat the
water to the maximum observed (1040F).       This could
be accomplished with circulation no deeper than about
1,500 feet (see p. B40).
 The water is believed to be moving into Death
Valley along faults in the Furnace Creek fault zone
and derived ultimately from the Pahrump Valley
(p. B38; see also Hunt and Robinson, 1960).      This
water is very different from that on the west side of
Cottonball Basin, which probably moves in along faults
from Mesquite Flat (p. B37; see       also   Hunt and
Robinson, 1960).
 The total dissolved solids in these spring waters is
low compared to other Death Valley water; but by the
