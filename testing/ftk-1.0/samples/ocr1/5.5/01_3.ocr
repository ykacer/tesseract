 1    ask you to introduce all the DOE folks here today.

2                MR. STEIN:  I will introduce them,  those who

3     will directly participate only I'm leaving the introductions

4     to Don Alexander at the end of the table in accordance

 5    with the agreed upon procedure that we had before we

 6    came in here.   Don has been working with the folks much

      closer than  I and I think that we ought to introduce them.

 8               MR. MILLER:  We received your letter in January,

      V can't recall the day, but since that time we have given

10    the annotated outline a review.   We have tapped our

11    technical people who are busy reviewing your EA's and

12    I would have to say that our review is best termed a best

13    level type review.   I think having said that however we

14    can give you feedback and I think it should be a productive

15    meeting.

16               But at some later time there may be some things

17    we found that--but we will do the best we can.    Let me

18    introduce the people from NRC here with me today right

19    at the outset.   Seth Coplan to my left,  the head of the

20    Nevada Test Site Project Section within my branch.

21    Marc Rhodes works for Seth,   just to my right.  Ed Rednier

22    is in the Regulations Section in my branch;   and Jim Wolf

23    is from the Office of the Executive Legal Director.

24               Several things that I think are going to be

25    necessary to talk about today in connection with this
