into the fund as soon as possible.
* Invest in mutual funds. Although
emergency funds should be kept liquid in
a bank, credit union or money-market
mutual fund, other savings should be in-
vested for a higher yield. Ungar suggests
growth stock funds for college savings.
They carry a higher risk than some mutual
funds, but have returned an average of 17
percent a year over five years. If Renae
and Pablo hold their shares for at least 10
years-until Leanne starts college-U ngar
says, "The risk would be somewhat miti-
gated." His advice: Buy only funds rated
four or five stars by Morningstar, the mu-
tual-fund rating service.
  Sharkey agrees, suggesting such no-
load mutual funds as Janus Fund, Neu-
berger & Berman Guardian or Partners
funds, and Financial Industrial Income
Fund.
* Make regular investments, re-
gardless of share prices. If you put a
set amount into a mutual fund every
month, you'll get more shares when prices
are low. This reduces your average cost
per share, producing what's known as
dollar-cost averaging. Starting small and
dollar-cost averaging, says Sharkey,
should ease Pablo's fear of investing.
* Restructure Pablo's life insur-

ance. With two young children and an
unemployed wife, Pablo needs more life
insurance than the $100,000 he carries.
Medley favors $300,000 of term life. Un-
gar suggests $500,000 of level term-
enough to pay off the Florida mortgage
and provide income for Renae and the
children. With careful shopping, he says,
Pablo should be able to buy the coverage
for $425 a year.
* Explore tax-sheltered saving
plans. The experts urge Pablo to contrib-
ute to the 401(k) tax-deferred savings
plan at work as soon as possible. This
should come before starting an IRA be-
cause most employers match contribu-
tions to a 401(k) plan-and those contri-
butions are not subject to current income
or Social Security taxes.
* Put the Florida house on the back
burner. "Wait out the housing cycle,"
says Medley. "Time-and not a lot of it-
may solve the problem." Even though the
Arayas have a small net loss from renting
the place, they do get tax advantages from
home ownership. If being landlords
proves emotionally wearing, they could
sell at a loss and borrow what's needed to
pay off the mortgage. The one thing they
should not do is abandon the Florida
home, even though they have little equity

in it. "Abandoning it could have economic
consequences for years in the future,"
says Sharkey
The flanges: A Lot loDe
Before Retirement
Peggy and Jim Hauge of Mitchell, South
Dakota, hope to retire in 12 years. Jim,
now 48, is a self-employed factory service
representative for an engineering compa-
ny. Peggy, 45, teaches school. The
Hauges own a 160-acre farm that netted
them $7,817 last year.
  Yet despite a good income, they save
very little. Although Peggy will get a pen-
sion of at least $500 a month if she keeps
teaching until age 591/2, Jim has no pen-
sion and no life or disability insurance.
  Where does their money go? "We just
spend it here, there and everywhere,"
says Peggy. Adds Jim: "I'd rather buy toys
than save." He has a gun collection worth
$5,000, for example. The couple owns
four vehicles (1989 Buick, 1988 Ford
van, 1982 Oldsmobile, 1968 Ford pick-
up); Jim also owns a 1952 Harley-David-
son motorcycle.
  The results of those free-spending ways
are all too clear. The Hauges have just
