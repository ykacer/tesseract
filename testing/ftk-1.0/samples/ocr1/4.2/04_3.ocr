where  C(~,t)  is   radionuclide concentration at position x and time t, R is
retardation  coefficient,   £ is  porosity, e is water saturation, D is dif-

fusivity,  h  is half-life and   is water velocity.  Equation (1~) is solved
numerically,  e.g.,   via a  finite difference method.  Then Eq. (1~) is ap-
proximated by

where  c  is  a  vector of concentrations at nodes {x~), A is a matrix which

             4
depends  on  u, R, ~, e and D and on the discretization.  The term Bb incor-
porates  boundary  conditions   and sinks/sources.  Equation (15) is called a
state-space  eqCiation.    If Eq. (15) is discretized in time, a state transi-
tion equation obtains

This  analysis  assumes  that A and b are constant over At (perfect temporal
correlation); this analysis is only concerned with spatial heterogeneity.
     Expanding Eq. (16) in Taylor series and taking the expected value leads
to the relation for the mean value (see Dettinger and Wilson, 1981)

where the subscript "o" indicates evaluated at mean value.   Equation (17) is
the first-order estimate of the mean and has the same form as Eq. (16).  The
second-order estimate has additional terms.
    The covariance is given by applying Eq. (13) to get

Any single term in Cov(c(t)) is
