fleas. On this day, all 7,500 of them are
happily standing upside down biting
through a plastic membrane to suck up
the cow's blood on the other side. One
Artificial Dog produces 12,000 fleas a
day, doing work that formerly employed
about 25 real dogs and cats.
  This morning, Georgi is gathering eggs.
He does it by removing the pens from the
dog, then opening each one over a funnel-
shaped "flea separator." The adult fleas
hop out and fall into the funnel, where the
vacuum's suction pins them against a
screen "in a high wind," as Georgi puts it.
The eggs stay behind.
  I comment on how this miracle system
lets no fleas escape when, sure enough,
one gets away. We both dive to the floor to
grab him, but the flea fakes left and goes
right, then right again and disappears.
  "If you don't get them by the second
hop, you usually don't get them," Georgi
says. We don't.
  But never mind. Right now, some
800,000 of its kin are stowed safely in
Ziploc bags in Georgi's freezer, ready for
sale. The question is, Who wants them?
  Mostly it's big drug companies and
chemical labs trying to help me-the lady
with two cats, four dogs, and Oriental
rugs that come to life each summer as
Ctenocephalides felis, the common flea,
takes over my home.
  And helping they are. By making an
extract from Georgi's livestock, Greer
Laboratories, Inc., in Lenoir, North Car-
olina, can now offer allergists and veteri-
narians antigen tests to tell whether you
or your dog or cat are itching because of
fleas or something else.
  Even better, during the past few years
companies have come up with a genuine
flea-relief breakthrough: new age com-
pounds called insect growth regulators.
  It's about time that something did the
trick. Professional exterminators say fleas
come right after cockroaches and termites
as the nation's most troublesome pests.
Consider that 110 million dogs and cats
are scattered among the nation's 94 mil-
lion households. And that fleas can be
debilitating to young animals and tor-
turous to those with allergies. In regions
of high humidity, flea allergy dermatitis is
the number one complaint at the vet's.
Americans spend a million dollars a day
fighting fleas at home and almost three
times that much-$1 billion each year-if
you figure in vet bills and exterminators.
  "Oh well, `A reasonable amount of
fleas is good for a dog,"' says Georgi,
quoting homespun philosopher David

How to Hurt a Flea

        SEE IF YOUR PET
      ACTUALLY HAS FLEAS

Often they aren't obvious, especially if
you're checking a feisty cat or a really
furry Saint Bernard.
Stand your pet on a clean white sheet.
Now brush the animal all over, down close
to the skin. If dark little comma-shaped
crumbs fall on the sheet, wet some with
water and rub a little. Turn red? It's "flea
dirt" -dried blood excreted by fleas. You've

got them.

STOP THEM FROM

    BREEDING IN YOUR HOME

Use an insect growth regulator. Look for
products containing either methoprene or
fenoxycarb, sold as do-it-yourself sprays.
Used properly, they're risk-free for you
and your animals but death to flea eggs
and larvae. "Foggers" with these growth
regulators are also good but tricky to use.
They mostly spread tiny droplets that fall
straight down and won't drift under sofas
or around corners. No matter what you
use, wash the per on the same day.
Vacuum, vacuum, vacuum. You'll not only
suck up lots of flea eggs, you'll starve any
lingering larvae. Use the powered, rotat-
ing "beater brush" attachment on your
vacuum. Then take that pointy crevice
tool and get tough with the couch and
baseboards. Repeat early and often.
Wash your pet's bedding once a week with
detergent. Dry on high hear. Flea pupae
die at temperatures above 95 0F and at
humidities below 50 percent. If your pet
doesn't have bedding, give him some.
You could even put a towel down in the
car or under a favorite napping bush.
Consider flea-killing dusts. If you can stand
the mess, diatomaceous earth supposedly
dehydrates fleas and their larvae when you
sprinkle it on your pet's bedding. It's hard
to find, though (check pet shops), and all
flea experts aren't convinced it helps.
  Borate powder (a.k.a. boric acid or borax)
is tougher on fleas, but you have to spread
the stuff on your furniture and carpets and
then make a point of nor cleaning it up.

     GO AFTER THE FLEAS ON
         THE DOG OR CAT

Attack first with a flea comb (available for
less than $10 in any pet shop). Dunk the
combed-our fleas into a bowl of soapy
water-quick, before they jump.
Wash your pet with a gentle shampoo and
sponge on an insecticide dip. Some people
prefer products with plant poisons such
as pyrethrins (from chrysanthemum flow-
ers) or D-limonene (from citrus peels). But
because some compounds are toxic to
cats and risky for infants, it's best to talk
over your whole chemical strategy with
a veterinarian.
Don't bet on flea collars. Scientists have
now tested dozens of fancy new "ultra-
sonic" collars and say flat out that they
don't work. In one rest, some pet owners
were given functioning collars; some oth-
ers got ones without batteries. Both groups
were equally pleased with the results.
 The more traditional insecticide-laced
collars do hurt fleas but release their poi-
son quickly and only up near the head.
Many vets advise against them.
 One possible exception is the new Ovi-
trol collar with insect growth regulators.
It should help keep fleas from reproducing.
Ignore your friends' advice. Trust me:
All the "alternative" methods are about
as effective as snapping your fingers to
keep elephants away. Garlic, brewer's
yeast, pennyroyal oil, cedar chips, euca-
lyptus nuts-they've all been touted as
remedies. But science asks for evidence-
dead fleas, irchless pets-and it's just not
there. In fact, veterinarian Jay Georgi
once raised healthy flea larvae on brewer's
yeast and garlic.
