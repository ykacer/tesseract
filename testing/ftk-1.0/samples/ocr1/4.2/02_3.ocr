   us assume that lengths Ji I.     are all superior to h. The estimation
   variance is obtaine(l by weighting the extension variance of each drift within
 K its influence panel by the square of the surface of this panel:

  The explored mineralized surface being S    l~ (5 -f-- U....+ !~) and the
total (leveloped length being L   l~ + /~ + ***l,~, we obtain the following
remarkable formula
                                     7r S

   Once the estimation variance has been calculated, one has still to in-
terpret it for practical uses under the form of conventional error spread.
This aim is reached by allocating to this variance a probabilistic meaning.
By implicit reference to a gaussian mo(lel, we shall take it that the actual
average grade of the deposit is included within a 95% probability in the
range ni ± 2o, rn being the estimated grade.   In other cases, l)artictilarlv if
2a-is not small towards ;u, we shall take the spread in exp (I 2o~ in), by
reference to a lognormal model.
   These implicit references to prol)abilistic models are mainly arbitrary.
Actually, the notion itself of statistical (listril)lition of an estimation error
is doubtlessly meaningless.   The only thing which has an objective physical
meaning is the variance.   This is why we speak about conventional spreads.
Their l)ractical interest resides in the fact that they (lra\x' a more intuitive
picttire of the possible errors than variances themselves.

   A secoit(l al)l)lication of major importance is provided by a geostatisdcal
procedure called "kriging.    It consists in estimating the grade of a panel by
comptiting the weighted average of available samples. some being located
inside others outside the panel.   The grads of these saml)lCs being x1,
         we attempt to evaluate the unknown grade z of the panel with
a linear estimator z~ of the form

 The suitable weights a; assigned to each sample are (letermfline(l by two
onditions.  The first one expresses that z~' and z must have the same aver-
ge val tie wit hin the whole large field I - and is written as:

  The second condition expresses that the a~ have such values that estima-
ion variance of z by z~. in other words the kriging variance, should take the
nlallest possible valtie.
