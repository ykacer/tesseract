Finding thc~

More than any other feature, your hair influences
the way you look. You can apply your makeup
perfectly, dress impeccably, but if your hair's not
right, everything's wrong. Here, we help four hair-
hampered women find a style that suits them.

problems
OPalo hair color made
skin lock washed-out.
OHer too-thick hair was
dry and damaged.
solutions
Changing Marian's hair
color to dark blonde
immediately warmed up
her skin tone. To get her
heavy hair under control,
we clipped off six inches
of damaged locks, blunt-
cut the bottom and added
long layers around her
frice. Ivory foundation
camel and rust eve
shadow, and apricot
blush continued the
warming trend.
