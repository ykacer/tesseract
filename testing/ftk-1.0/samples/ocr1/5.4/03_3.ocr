 Car thieves prefer ragtops.
 And the convertibles of
choice last year for the dis-
criminating crook were the
Volkswagen Cabriolet and
Ford Mustang, according to
figures compiled by the High-
way Loss Data Institute.
 At the bottom of the list of
cars from 1991 to 1993 was
the unlovely and - happily
- unwanted Chevrolet Cava-
lier station wagon.
 The Virginia-based re-

search agency came up with
the list by compiling 1993 in-
surance claims filed ~vith 15
major companies.
 Researchers also found

that:
* Car-theft claims were
made almost twice as often in
large metropolitan areas as
in the rest of the country. De-

troit led the nation with 21.5
claims per 1,000 insured ye-
hides.
* Anti-theft devices that ac-
tually incapacitate cars, like
GM's computer PASS-key sys-
tem, deter car thieves.
* The number of theft claims
for newer cars last year hit a
new low, but insurance com-
panies paid more per claim
than ever before.
 New York's car thieves
don't follow national norms,
though, according to police
figures. They prefer older,
boxier cars. With ~ Wire S.rvlce
