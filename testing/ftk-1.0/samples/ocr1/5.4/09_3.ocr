    centers

Addiction medicine, one of the hottest medical specialties
today, has grown up in a huffy. The American Society of
Addiction Medicine, formed in 1954 mostly to treat the
ravages of alcoholism, now has 3,500 members, all
physicians. The following facilities offer highly regarded

programs for treating addictive behaviors. Some specialize in
alcohol and drug addiction; others treat "dual diagnosis" patients, who
suffer from chemical dependency as a result of sexual abuse or
other traumas. Most of the centers listed have inpatient and outpatient
programs with aftercare services. Patients stay from one week to seven
months, at a cost ranging from $200 to $1,000 per day. Be warned: Most
medical-insurance policies do not fully reimburse treatment costs.
