where     and j are unit vectors in the x- and y-directions,
respectively, and the sign depends on the orientation of the
extra atomic plane forming the dislocation.
    Edge    dislocations  move  easily only  in their slip ior
glidet  plane.  Motion    perpendicular to the  slip plane by
climb requires transport of vacancies or interstitials to or
from   the   hulk  of   the solid to the dislocation  line by
diffusion.   Point defect migration under most conditions is
Yow hecause the concentrations of vacancies or interstitials
is  quite   low.  However,   at temperatures   above  roughly
one-half   the  melting   point (K) or in a radiation    field.
-~ufflcient  point defects are present and their mobility is
great enough to permit edge dislocation climb to take place
at  measurable     rates. The  climb   process is of  primary
importance    in   the  slow plastic deformation   mechanism
known as creep. \vhich profoundly affects the performance
of reactor fuel elements.
    The    force  causing climb  is not restricted to external
stresses applied to the solid, as shown in     Fig. SlOb. The
internal   stress  due   to  the  presence of   other nearby
dislocations    or  to   the creation  of high  point  defect
supersaturation hy radiation can also induce climb of the
edge portions of dislocations  Chap. 16. Sec. 16Th.
    A similar analysis can be applied to a screw dislocation.
Figure 8.11   shows a screw dislocation of length S which
expenences a force per unit length F in the slip direction
due to an applied shear stress a..,. The subscripts on the
shear stress indicate that it acts in the sup plane ~which is
perpendicular to     the y*axisp and in the direction of the

i-axis. Note that in this case the force on the dislocation
line is at right angles to the direction of the applied stress
that produces the force. If the screw dislocation moves a
distance Ax  in  the x  direction, an area S Ax slips by
a distance b in the slip direction i the z-direction . The work
done by   the applied stress is o~.,S Axb. Equating this
quantity of work to a force on the dislocation line acting in
the x-direction times the distance the line moves, we lind
the force on a unit length of screw dislocation produced hy
the shear stress to be

As in the case of stresses acting on edge dislocations, choice
of    or - in Eq. 814 depends on the sign of the dislocation
 i.e.. whether the screw is left-handed or right-handed).
    The dependence of the direction of the force exerted
by  a  shear stress  on  the sign of both   edge and screw
dislocations implies   that the dislocation  loop shown  in
Fig. 8.6 can be    made  to expand  uniformly in the radial
direction by a shear force in the direction of the arrow in
the   drawing. The   x-direction force exerted on the edge
component at A is ~ b. and the edge component at C is
subject to a force -u~~ b - SI milarlv - the v-direction forces
on the screw components at B and D are -o~.b and ~       b.
respectively -
    Tensile or compressive stresses produce no force on a
screw  dislocation,  which  is incapable of  movement   by
climb.

       DISLOCATIONS

8.5.1   Density of Dislocation Lines
    The  concentration   of dislocation lines in a solid is
measured by the number of dislocation lines that penetrate
a  unit area within    the crystal. This quantity. which is
known    as  the   dislocation density, ranges  from  `-i~~
dislocations cm    in high.purity carefully prepared semicon-
ductor  single crystals  )germanium  or silicon) to
