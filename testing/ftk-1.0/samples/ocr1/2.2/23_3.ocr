transition  in  mantle   source  regions  througn  time
may be  indicatec by a transition    from normal to Rb-
depleted,   Sr-enrichec    hawaiites   in  the younger
basaltic  cycles.   The  recurrence   of small  volumes
of hawajite   magma at Crater   Flat  supports  assump-
tions  required  for  probability   modeling  of future
volcanic  activity  and  provides   a basis   for esti-
mating  the   effects  of  volcanic   disruption  of  a
repository   site  in  the  southwestern   Nevada  Test
Site  region.  Preliminary  data  suggest that succes-
sive  basalt  cycles  at Crater   Flat  may be  of  de-
creasing volume but recurring more    frequently.

I.    INTRODUCTION
      The   Nevada  Nuclear   Waste  Storage   Investigations   (NNWSI)  are  evaluating
the   suitability   of  the Nevada   Test  Site  (NTS)  for location   of  a  high-level
radioactive     waste repository.  Current   geologic  exploration    studies within  the
NTS   are focused   on  Yucca  Mountain   (Dixon  et al.  1980),   a  large  fault block
composed    of   multiple   sequences  of   ash-flow  tuff  erupted    from   the Timber
Mountain-Oasis Valley cauldron complex       (Byers et al.  1976).
      Yucca   Mountain  is located within   the  south-central  Great  Basin,   a physic-
graphic   subprovince   of  the  larger   Basin  and  Range   Province,  which  includes
much of the western United States.        The Great Basin is a tectonically active     re-
gion.     Its   geologic  history  is  characterized   by extensional    block  faulting
that  produced   linear mountain   ranges  separated  by broad   alluvial  basins (Nolan
1943;   Stewart  1978;  Christiansen   and  McKee  1978).   This   faulting  was closely
associated    in time  and  space  with silicic  volcanic  activity   at major  cauldron
complexes.      Silicic volcanic   rocks  as old as  40 to 45 Myr    are present  in  the
central   Great    Basin.   Younger  volcanic    rocks occur    within  broadly  arcuate
belts   that  are  successively younger   to the  south and toward    the margins of the
Great Basin     (Armstrong et al.  1969;  Scott et al.  1971;   Noble 1972;   Stewart and
Carlson   1978).    Silicic rocks  of  late  Miocene age  are most abundant within     an
east-west-trending     belt of   the south-central   Great  Basin.    This   belt extends
from  southeastern    Nevada  through  the  NTS region  and may   bend to  the  northwest
along   the Walker Lane    structural  trend (Stewart  and Carlson    1978).  Since about
14 Myr    ago,  two major  changes   in the patterns  of tectonic    and volcanic  activ-
ity   have  occurred.   First,   there has  been a  progressive   concentration  of   tec-
tcnic   activity    toward  the  marc~',s of the  Great  Basin   (Scholt:  et   al. 1971;
