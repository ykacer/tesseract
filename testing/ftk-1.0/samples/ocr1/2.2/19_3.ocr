communication from its remote location, prearrang~d short wave
radio contact was ma(le with Fallon, 80 miles distant tw road.
When the ore was exhausted in 1940, the operation was shut
down and all surface plant subsequently s01(1.     Only the shaft,
stopes caved to the surface, and the tailing pile remain as evi-
dence of past activity.
  The Penelas ore occurred in two veins, both in andesite and
rhyolite, having an average width of about 5 feet.     Mining was
(Jone on nine levels spaced 100 feet apart with about 4,000 feet of
laterals.  The 6th, 7th and 8th levels are said to have been the
most productive, the main ore shoot having been &~bout 150 feet
long. As stated by L. 1). Cordon, no values were found below the
900-foot level.
  The Ole l~eft,IxoII bull.. oPerate(l by I~(   rs~~n in 1936 as the
Golden Eagle, is the southern and more important retained part
of several adjoining properties purchased in 1915 by the Kansas
City-Nevada Consolidated Mines Company.         It is situated along
the crest of the north end of the l~ara(lise Range about 15 miles
northwest of lone.   The Penelas adjoins this property on the
southeast.   The present owner is Mrs. Esther Peterson of Super-
ior, Wisconsin.  The mine was last leased to John Chisholm and
George Erwin who made I)erio(lic shipments of gojd ore in 1938.
  At the Paymaster claim on the north end of th~ group the ore
occurs in a poorly defined zone along a rhyolite-andesite contact.
An excellent one and one-half compartment 375-foot shaft, with
levels each 125 feet and about 2,000 feet of laterals, was sunk prior
to 1920.   Except for the collar set, the timbers show no signs of
decay and the ladders are in good con(Iition.    It is reported that
the principal values were found above the 125-foot level and that
careful selective mining was necessary.      A 50-ton cyanide mill,
built in 1919 and destroyed by fire a few years later, was appar-
ently unjustified as no recorded pro(ltiction is shown for the com-
pany.    Broken hills, 12 miles west, was probably the principal
source of ore for the mill.  Little or no work has been done on the
Paymaster since about 1923.
  The July Lode, at the south end, is the only part of the property
having an appreciable production.  It is from here that Ole Peter-
son and lea~ers are said to have produced about $70,000 in the
years 1936 to 1944. The ore occurence here is different from the
Paymaster in that quartz is more abundant and the ratio of gold
to silver is much greater.   The values are found in a brecciated
rhyolite recemented with quartz and occurring ~n a chimney-like
ore shoot approximately 14 feet by 8 feet in crliss-section which
