 A Very Racy One Lap
Hordes of competitors in a commendably schizophrenic array of cars manage
            once again to somehow achieve the possible.
                      BY STEVEN COLE SMITH

B rock Yates is getting tense. Just hours
    before the 1993 One Lap of America
    is set to flag off, one of the highest-
profile entries is short a driver.
  Of course, this being the tenth-annual
One Lap, it would be unprecedented for
all to go without at least the threat of mild
calamity. And this problem is certainly
minor in comparison to, say, 1985, when
Ralph Nader threatened to block the start of
One Lap with a bunch of people in wheel-
chairs, symbolizing his belief that

driving for enjoyment is somehow sinful.
  Nonetheless, this qualifies as a crisis:
Doug Shepherd, a rally driver and man-
ager for Advanced Chassis Packaging for
Chrysler, was scheduled to drive thc
Chrysler-sponsored Dodge Viper. He
droppcd out at the last minute because a
freak storm damaged his house.
  Yates is scrambling to fiiid a replace-
ment when his cycs land on Elliot Forbes-
Robinson, an accomplished road racer
   who just happens to be here because

he towed one of his neat little Legends
race cars from North Carolina to
donate for the auction that would be
held after the One Lap to benefit the
Ronald McDonald Children's Chari-
ties. Forbes-Robinson is promptly
enlisted to drive the Viper along with
Don Jankowski, a vehicle-develop-
ment engineer on the Viper team.
Relieved, Yates reverts to his normal
state of semi-tenseness.
   So at 12:30 a.m. on June 9, a
 Tuesday, the Bridgestone-sponsored
 Car and Driver 1993 One Lap of

America began its 2800-mile, 89-hour
round trip at the Race Rock Cafe, a snazzy
automotive-themed eatery in the Detroit
suburb of Fraser.
  The Race Rock, run by ex-elephant
trainer Bobby Moore, has a Newman-Hans
Indy car suspended from the ceiling, which
revolves over the bar. Upside-down. This
is good to know in advance, otherwise you
are likely to glance up, take one look at
your drink, and place an emergency call to
Betty Ford.
  Regular readers know that One Lap
began in 1984 as a generally law-abiding,
8500-mile, week-long endurance rally run
round the countiy, from Detroit to Detroit
usually by way of California, Texas, and
Florida. One Lap is a kinder, gentler evo-
lution of Yates's not-even-remotely-legal
Cannonball Run, which was a mad dash
from New York to Los Angeles. Yates dis-
continued the Cannonball Run in 1979,
aware that it was just a matter of time
before a competitor I-boned a bus from the
Our Lady of Perpetual Motion Rest Home,
likely resulting in unfavorable publicity.
