(Figure 2c),  an area of stagnant water is
formed. A high accumulation of mineral con-
stituents is probable at these places. Below such
a stagnant body of groundwater, flow occurs
again and may result in a better quality of
water than that from shallower depths.
  7.  Decreasing potential with depth in re-
charge areas and increasing potential in dis-
charge areas are direct conscquences of the the-
ory and can be observe(l in all diagrams of
Figure 2. It shunld be itoted, however, that such
a configuration of the equipotential hues is pro-
nounced only in the immediate vicinities of the
highs and lows. The midlines and their vicinities
are locations of relatively straight, vertical equi-
potential lines.
  8.  From Figure 2 it can safely be stated that
the major stream of tile basin receives ground-
water  contributions only from the adjacent
topographic highs and from possible regional
flow. The latter is probably unimportant in
most cases because of the low rate of flow. It
is conceivable, then, that the methods in which
baseflow data are used for computation of basin-
wide characteristics (average recharge, permea-
bility, etc.) are misleading or erroneous. Even

if the two flanks of a basin are of low relief,
that there are no local systems, the bulk of ti
basin discharge will take place between the mi
line and the valley bottom and only a small par
tion will appear as baseflow.
 9.  A further consequence of the theory
that tile water levels at shallow (leptils are tL
most affected by season:d recharge and di
charge. `like small intake and outlet areas of U
interlnediatc and   regional zones prevent U
water levels from fitietnating widely. Plotaikc
