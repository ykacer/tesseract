Need for Thermal   Analysis


    Many aspects of waste package design and testing depend          in part on tne
temperature environment to which the emplaced       packages will    be exposed.
information produced by thermal     analysis  is  needed for the following reasons.


    o     *o demonstrate   triat designs will  not exceeo maximum temperature
          criteria for   tne various  waste forms:    773 K (5000C)  for Defense High
          ~evel  waste  ~`DHL~J) glass, 673 K (40000)  for Commercial   rlign Level
          waste  <LW)    glass,  aria 623 K  (3500C)  for Spent Fiel   ~SF);


    o     .o provide  orojected   temperature  nistories   for materials   selection;


    0     ½ assist   in  trie verification of  tne performance analysis coae,      wAPPA


    0     To provide temperature boundary conditions for tne performance
          analysis  code;


    o     ½  provide  tne  temperature environment    for  transportation,   nanoling,
          storage  and  retrieval  analyses;


    o     To calculate   approximate  time periods    of steam/water contact with
          waste  pacKage;


    o     To provide temperature histories for corrosion testing;


    o     To provide temperature nistories     for waste form    leach testing;


    0     To provide temperature histories     and boundary conditions for very
          near  field steam/air/water    porous  flow calculations;

 * (~APPA  is  a one-dimensional    code designed    to calculate the corrosion      and
 leacning  of  the  various  waste  package components     and  to calculate the eventual
 ~reacning  and  the  release   rate  to the repository.     WAPPA consists    of  five
 process  suomodels   including   the radiation,    thermal,   mechanical,   corrosion   aid
 leach suomodels).
