dispersed    joints have   been modeled   [Snow,
1905], a fcw examl)lcs of which arc shown here
in  stcrcograhic   projcctions. Systcins of  any
desired complexity can be generated by coin-
bining individual dispersions (liffering in direc-
tion of central tendency, dispcrsion coefficient,
or spacilig. Plate 1 shows the change of aniso-
tropy for a single set having a given dispcrsion
as the sample size changes. Plate 2 shows the
effect of decreasing oricntation disl)CrsiOn from
Fisher's Kr = 0 to 60. Plate 3 treats two ortlin-
gonal sets, Plate 4 two nonordiogonal sets, and
Plate 5 three orthogonal sets.
  In any one model, spacing has been main-
tamed by proportioning the sample size of each
set accortling to equation 26 and Figure 5.
  Also displayed in stereographic lirojection are
the principal pernicahility axes for 49 sampl-
ings, disclosing die range of possible solutions.
Orthogonal triplets of diamonds,     circles, and
crosses correspond to maximum, intermediate,
and minimum permeability axes. The scatter
simulates the variation in princiPal permeability
axes that must exist from one place to another
in jointed rock. The axes close on mean direr-
tioiis as the sample size or volume increases.
Dispersion of the axes wonlil be coiicealeil by
mean values, using only large salilliles. Note
that  aberrant    axial  orientations are possible
