 The induced decomposition of hyponitrites has bccn reported to take place at 0'
in the presence of nitrogen dioxide.102 The reactions that occur are those found in
the thermal decomposition of hyponitrites:

These results appear to be quite different from those of Addison, Gamlen and
Thompson ~ ~ ho find that unlike nitrite and nitrate, hyponitrite and oxyhypo-
nitrite (Na~N2O3) are immediately oxidized by liquid nitrogen dioxide.
  The explosive decomposition of trieth~lammoniUm nitrate and nitrogen dioxide
mixtures has been mcnt~oned10' and the reaction cf sodamide ~vith nitrogen dioxide
in carbon tetrachloride solution has been shown to result in the production of the
amidonit rate.

                 The Action of Nitrogen Dioxide on Nletals
  Nitrogen dioxide readily attacks many metals and several papers describing such
reactions are of a technical nature. Earlier work indicated that nitrogen dioxide
attacks iron and ~ 107 and it was later suggested 108 that in the case of
~"rr~ ~roducFi~TW~ oxide. Cu2O. With mercury the products of reaction were
thought to be mercurouS nitrite an~ mercuric nitrite.154 Recently `~ the reaction has
been shown to be represented by the equation:

The reaction of selenium ~`ith gaseous nitrogen dioxide produces selenium dioxide.
The interaction of nitrogen dioxide with atomic sodium results in a powerful chemi-
luminescencC~   which has been attributed to the folio" ing scheme''2:

  Frequently the reaction of nitrogen dioxide in the liquid phase with a metal results
in the formation of an adherent film which slows down any subsequent reaction.
This is apparently not so with zinc and hence the reaction with this element has been
thoroughly examined. The alkali metals react rapidly and controllably ~~ith liquid
dinitrogen tetroxide to yield the corresponding nitrates but no nitrite." Zinc reacts
readily with nitrogen dio,~ide to give a white crystalline solid, insoluble in nitrogen
dioxide, and having the formula Zn(NOj)2,2N.04.113 At 1000 the pure anhydrous
nitrate is formed. The kinetics of this reaction have been examined114 as has the
effect of the addition of dinitrogen trioxide or ritrosyl chloride. In the former case
no additional compounds are formed, although the rate of reaction is increased.115
With nitrosyl chloride, depending on the conditions of reaction, it is possible to
obtain the chloride or the nitrate, sometimes solvated."8
  Solutions of diethylnitrosamine in dinitrogeit tetroxide behave in a mann:  that
may be interpreted in terms of the follo~'ing c~juilibria117:

Zinc reacts with these solutions to yield a r.d liquid, immiscible with nitrogen
dio\ide,iiS ~~hich is the same as the solution ol'ained by dissol~'ing Zn(NOJL2N~O4
