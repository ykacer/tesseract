The pressure drop on  the fracture     for a vertical
fracture at the center of a square (Xe   Ye and xw =

The pressure drops on the fracture for a uniforn,
flux fracture and for an infinite-conductivity fracture
are obtained by evaluating Eq.  29 at x0    0 anc
   = 0.732, respectively. The choice of the same
point as in   the infinite case leads to reasonable
results  and  can be  justified a poslenori by the
method of dcsupcrpusif:on, presented later in this
paper.   Numerical  values  of  the dimensionless
