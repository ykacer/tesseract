               CHAIRMAN PALLADINO:  Thank you.

  2            well, let me ask one question either or both of

  2   you can comment on.

               If I understand DOE's position,  it is that the

      purpose of the preliminary determination was to assure all

  6   parties that they were going after sites that really had

  7   the potential for being suitable, based on the availability

               Now, if one waits until after characterization,

  ~0  then is this a preliminary decision?   I admit it is a more

  Ii  firm decision, but do you think that is in keeping with the

  12  intent as DOE expresses it or interprets it?

  12           MR.  TOUSLEY:  I would say that a determination

  LI  following characterization would certainly still be

  15  preliminary.  It would be certainly preliminary to the

  6   ultimate decisions by the Commission on licensing as to the

  7   suitability of the site.

  18           Even the Commission's licensing decisions are

  19  going to be preliminary in this program because we won't

  20  know for a long time whether these sites are really

  21  suitable.

  22           flaking the determination prior to characterization

  23  is so preliminary as to be meaningless.   They are making

  24  that determination in selecting the sites to characterize.

  25  It doesn't add anything to that to say,   `We preliminarily
