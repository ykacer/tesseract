purported to be cleared for farming
and graced with a house and a well.
 Father and David said farewell to
my mother and to the children:
Harry, David's elder brother, and
Anne, Mary, and Rose. They depart-
ed by train with a huge trunk, large-
ly filled with tools, and with a supply
of tremendous sandwiches and a con-
tainer of tea adequate for the three-
day journey through the plains of Illi-
nois, the hills of Tennessee and the
pine wilderness of the deep South.
 Foley lies south of Mobile, within
25 miles of the Gulf of Mexico. Upon
their arrival, Father and Dave went
to the sheriff's office, where they
found a kindly man who addressed
them with a German accent. Since
Father could speak German, a warm
relationship sprang up between the
two men.
 The first things my father needed,
the sheriff told him, were a horse and
wagon. Yes, he knew exactly where
both might be purchased. The price
was $80, and since the mare was in
foal, my father thought this a bargain.
 Guided by the sheriff, they fol-
lowed a dirt country road eight miles
to the farm. There, Pa discovered
that instead of 60 acres being
cleared, as represented, only 10 were
suitable for farming. Nevertheless,
he set about putting in a crop qf
peas, for which the sheriff assured
him there was a ready market in
Pensacola, Fla., 30 miles distant.
 He also went to work on the house,
adding to one side of it and building
a screened-in bedroom for David.
 He cut down a large tree and
scooped out the inside of the trunk so
it could be filled with water as a
horse trough. He bought chickens
and planted peas, corn and lettuce.
Once, he thought he had located a
supply of wild lettuce, which he
made into a sumptuous salad, only
to discover after the first bite that it
was tobacco!

~4 WED BY DAVE AND ThE
         horse, Pa worked
         from  morning to
         night, then relaxed
         by reading, in the
light of a kerosene lamp, one of the
three books he brought with him: one
contained the essays of Charles Lamb
and Robert Louis Stevenson, another
consisted of lectures on evolution by
Charles Darwin, and the third was a
Yiddish book of fairy tales.
 Almost from the first, my father
recognized the hopelessness of it.
Surrounded by forest and under-
brush that would take years to clear,

they had acquired. After nine
months, when Father knew that the
farm project was a failure, the most
painful part for David was seDing
the calf.
 When the letter arrived telling
Mother that Pa was giving up and
coming back to Chicago, she cried,
softly and helplessly, for three days.
She, too, loved farming and had
shared my father's dreams. Now
what would h~come of them?

a job. H was stern with himself. "A
man must suffer," he said.
 Dave, who had been a poor stu-
dent before, now dropped out of
school and at the age of 14 persuad-
ed a recruitment officer that he was
16 and enlisted in the Army. He
served as a bugler in World War I
and, after being mustered out, grav-
itated to Texas, where he worked on
a cattle ranch.
 I was born during that war, but it
was years later that Dave again re-
turned home and I met my "true"
brother, whose heroic existence I had
shared in my dreams. I regarded
him as my "true" brother because of
my identification with his exciting
life and because my other brother,
Harry, was so much older, lived
apart from us with his own family
(including a son whom I detested),
and he simply did not seem like a
brother. How wonderful it must be, I
thought, to have a brother to play
with. All I had were sisters, and they
were no fun at all.
 My sisters assured me that Dave
had been a boy of infectious charm
and outstanding good looks, with jet
black hair and great black eyes.
What none of us knew, of course, was
that Dave had turned mean.

where my mother and father slept. I
slept on a day bed that was unfolded
nightly in the dining room.
 The great room, however, was the
parlor, which was never occupied ex-
cept by the most important visitors or
used except for state occasions, such
as the death of an aunt. It could be
looked at, but woe to me if my moth-
er caught me stepping across the in-
visible barrier that separated it from
our normal living quarters. The sight
alone, however, was an aesthetic ex-
perimc~s(aame magnitude. The far-
niture was all bought at the store on
12th Street called Hartman's. On the
day it was acquired, we all went to
this great store, and my mother and
my sisters chose each piece after
much study and deliberation.
 I can still see this special furniture
being uncrated in our flat, with my
mother anxiously in attendance to
make certain each object was in per-
fect condition, her `~jewels" from the
shana (beautiful) store.
 The rug that covered the floor was
russet with a gold border, floating
softly on the shining surface of var-
nished hardwood. A large bay win-
dow faced directly over Douglas
Park, about whose trees that radiant
light we see only in childhood slant-
ed through the Venetian blinds (they
were the latest thing) and patterned
the pale, white walls with bright hor-
izontal shafts and glowed on the
dark, polished furnishings, the ma-
hogany sofa with its velvet uphol-
stery and the outrageously coiffured
curls that bedecked the legs of the
center table.
 Our fiat was on the third floor of a
building that housed virtually every
living member of my family-uncles
and aunts, cousins and near cousins.
