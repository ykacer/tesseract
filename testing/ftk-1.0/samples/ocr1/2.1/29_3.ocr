British jet shot down in Bosnia

  SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina - A
British warplane was shot down Saturday
on a NATO mission over the Muslim town
of Gorazde as the U.N.-declared safe area
appeared on the verge of falling to Bosnian
Serb forces.
  The pilot, who was trying to identify
Serb tanks shelling Gorazde, ejected after
the plane was struck by a surface-to-air mis-
sile, U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink said.

  The pilot, who landed in Muslim-held ar-
ea just outside Gorazde, suffered minor in-
juries and was rescued an hour later by
government forces.
  The loss of the British jet and the town's
desperate plight highlighted the world com-
munity's seeming inability to stop the Serbs.
  The United Nations declared Gorazde a
"safe area" for Muslims last year, but the
Serbs have continued their siege with little
retaliation from the NATO forces that were
supposed to ensure protection.
  As Serb tanks were reported 1% miles

from the town center and advancing Satur-
day, the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen.
Ratko Miadic, predicted Gorazde would be
captured.
   Late Saturday, Sarajevo radio reported
Serb forces to the south were within a third
of a mile of downtown and 1¼ miles on the
eastern and northern front.
   However, the chairman of the Bosnian
Serb self-appointed assembly In Pale, Mom-
cilo Krajlsnik, told Belgrade radio that no
Serbian forces had advanced Saturday on
Gorazde.

  Bosnian Serbs also denied shooting down
the plane, and Bosnian Serb leader Radov-
an Karadzic denied Serbian forces had en-
tered the town.
  Diplomatic maneuvering intensified.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrel Kozyrev
made a hasty trip to Serb-led Yugoslavia to
talk to Serbian President Slobodan Mllosev-
Ic and Russian special envoy Vitaly Churkin
met with Krajlsnik.
