   Offsite Man-Made Events          *  Loss of HVAC in such locations as

In-Plant Failures                      - fire in waste-handling building,

events.     A one-to-one correlation across the table is not implied.

6.2.2  Design of Mitigating Features

6.2.2.1  Introduction

     Neither the  identification nor the analyses of  the DBAs needed to
identify mitigating  features has been completed.   Identification of   an
initial set of mitigating features is scheduled for the ACD.  This section
discusses the methods planned for identifying and establishing the design
requirements of  features needed to prevent or mitigate releases   to the
accessible environment.

6.2.2.2  Methods for Identifying Mitigating Features

     The process  envisioned to determine  the design features necessary
for  the prevention  or mitigation of offsite releases is    summarized in
Figure 6-3.  The objective is to identify, by performing analyses of all
