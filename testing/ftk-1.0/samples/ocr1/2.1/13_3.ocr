     Pinvon-juniper woodland is not represented in the southern Argus
Mountains or Slate Range; but this zone is represented above 6,500 or
7,000 feat in the Panamint Mountains, some 20 miles northeast of Searles
Lake and in the northern Argus Mountains 20 miles northwest of Searles
Lake.  Associated with this zone are mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus),
cliff rose (Cowania), sage (Artemisia), and mistletoe (Arceuthobxum).


                   ~tIDER1 POLLtN RAIN AT SLAR2~ES LA1~E

     In 1963, a series of modern pollen traps were placed in an east-west
transect across the south end of Searlas Lake basin along an abandoned
trackway (see C. I. Smith,  fig. 2).  The traps are standard rain gages
equipped with filters of 10-micron mesh set in the funnel of the gages.
The instruments were set up in October when few plants were blooning, and
the' pollen filters were collected in 1964, exactly a year later.   Samples
thus obtained are assumed to represent aerial pollen rain for a while
year's interval.  Trap samples were analyzed for relative compos'~Tmr and
for total numz,ers of pollen grains trapped per square centimeter per year.
Soil samples from each site were analyzed for contained pollen.     The
purpose of this transect was to determine the absolute number and compo.
sirion of the modern pollen rain at both basin and mountain sites, and to
compare airborne pollen rain with pollen in local modern soils, anc with
the subsurface pollen strstigrsphy.

     The results of this study are sizmm~arized in figure 1.  Absolute
numbers of pollen per aquare ca/yr ranged from about 200 to 1,200.    The
higher fallout occurred on the divides (see bottom of fig. 1).    The most
co~n pollen types found in the pollen traps for the year 1963-196.4
were found to represent groups that grow in Searles Valley.    Pollen types
probably fron local plants include:

     Chenopodiaceae  ssltbush family:   10-30 percent of the counts with
the higher percentages occurring on the fans where membere of this family
are best represented.  Members of this fsmily cannot be assigned to genus,
except for greasewood (Sarcobatus) (a rare pollen type growing in Death
Valley), and hence one cannot say which local genera of Chenopodiaceac are
represented.  Sest representation of Chenopodiateae pollen both in absolute
numbers per square centimeters per year and in percentages of the counts
is in the fan areas where members of this family dominate the vegetation.

     Compositie, daisy family:  between 10 and 32 percent of counts.   The
Franseria pollen type, which can be recognized by its long spines, is best
represented on cbe ridgetops  where this plant is most abundant.    Percentages
of ehort-spinad Compositae are about the same across the transect.    Absolute
numbers of Composita. pollen are greatest on the ridgetops, in part due to
a higher representation of rranseria pollen fallout, but also because total
fallout was greatest there.  Artemisia (sage) of this family is excluded
from the Compoeitae counts in figure 1 and is discussed later.
