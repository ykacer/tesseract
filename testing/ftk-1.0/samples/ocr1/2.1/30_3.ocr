            workings   are  the  Victory   tungsten
            mine.   Rocks are Triassic(?) volcanic
            rocks and Triassic and Jurassic sedi-
            mentary rocks   intruded by a group of
            Cretaceous plutons ranging from gran-
            odiorite   to granite.    Tungsten and
            lead-silver   deposits   occur  in  the
            contact    aureoles  of   the  piutons.
            Beyond the Lodi    Hills is the Paradise
            Range.

32.1   1.7    Gabbs.   Processing  plant of  Basic,
            mc.     for  magnesite-brucite    ores.
            Much   of  the  magnesite   is used  to
            produce     ref actory   products   for
            furnaces.    The magnesite and brucite
            occur   in dolomite of    the Triassic
            Luning Formation,    in the mineralized
            area,  dark  fine-grained dolomite has
            been marmorized to a lighter colored,
            coarser-grained massive dolomite that
            is  intergrown  in varying proportions
            with   magnesite.    A great variety of
            dikes   as  well as  a stock of  grano-
            diorite   intrude the  Luning Formation
            in the vicinity of the deposit.    The
              magnesite  (and recrystallized dolo-
            mite)   is  believed to have  formed by
            the    hydrothermal    replacement   of
            regionally   metamorphosed  sedimentary
            dolomite (Schilling,   1966).

            sists ofPermian(7) metavolcanic rocks
            and  Triassic   and  Jurassic carbonate
            and clastic rocks    intruded by a group
            of Cretaceous plutons and overlain by
            Miocene     silicic    Ignimbrites  and
            Intermediate to silicic lavas.

              The Fairplay mining district is lo-
            cated about 8 miles to the southeast.
            Most of    the mines   in the Fairplay
            district    are associated  with   epi-

             thermal precious    metal deposits  in
             Tertiary volcanic rocks.

             Also,   scheel ite-bearing     tactite
             occurs adjacent to a granitic pluton.
             in 1978,  UV   Industriesannounced  the
             discovery   in  this  district  of  28
             million tons of rock containing 0.25%
             molybdenite with values in silver and
             copper.

37.3    2.6    Junction   with   Poleline  Road  to
             Tonopah.

                FMC's  Paradise Peak Deposit     is
             located approximately   4.5 miles east
             on the Poleline Road.

43.8    1.8  The Rex mercury occurrence is located
             on the  left   (east).  Mercury occurs
             in Tertiary    intermediate volcanics.
             The mineralization   is associated with
             silicification,    argillization,   and
             native sulfur, and    is similar to the
             gold  mineralization  at  the  Paradise
             Peak  deposit.     The first  rock-chip
             sample was taken    at the Rex mercury
             occurrence,    and  led to FMC's dis-
             covery of the Paradise Peak orebody.

44.8    1.0  Road to Rawhide on west side of high-
             way.

             The Rawhide gold-silver deposit   is a
               joint-venture project between Kenne-
             cott Corp.,   Plexus  mc,.  and  Kiewit
             Mining Group   Inc.  The deposit has 24
             million tons of ore of current mine-
             able reserves which average .045 oz/T
             Au and  .47 oz/T Ag.  The ore is amen-
             able  to  heap-leach    processing  and
             mining will  be an open pit operation.

                The gold mineralization occurs     in
