   Figure 2 depicts the characteristic curves (saturation-pressure relationships)

for the matrix (Peters et al., 1984) and the vertical fractures in the five units. As

apparent from Figure 2, the fractures in all units easily desaturate with a small

suction of -0.1 m to -1. m of pressure head. For the matrix, significant desatura-

tion occurs only when the pressure-heads are in the order of -100 m. For the

welded Tiva Canyon unit (Fig. 2a), the welded Topopab Spring unit (Fig. 2c) and

the zeolitic Calico Hills unit (Fig. 2e), significant saturations (0.3 or more) can be

maintained even with pressure heads in the -1,000 m range. For the nonwelded

Paintbrush unit (Fig. 2b) and the vitric Calico Hills unit (Fig. 2d), most of the

saturation change occurs over a relatively narrow pressure range around -100 m,

indicating a nearly uniform pore-size distribution.  Some of the differences in

characteristic curves between the welded and nonwelded tuff may be related to

deposition processes whereby well-sorted ash falls form the nonwelded units and

the microscopically heterogeneous induration processes convert large ash flows

into welded tuff (Sinnock, personal communication, 1985).
