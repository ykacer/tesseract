Cosiments that appear nearly identical for the different sites reflect
information that was presented in the final EA's that was very similar among
sites.   Similar connents do, however, take into consideration differences
resulting from site-specific information.
CCNCLUSIO?~S AND RECOMMENDATIONS
It is apparent that significant efforts were made by DOE to respond to the NRC
staff major couinents on the draft LA's, and in fact many of these counents have
been resolygo.   however, for each of the final LA's our revIew ident1f~ed
remaining concerns many of whIch are the same type of concerns identified in
our review of the draft EAs such as 1) not identifying the range of
uncertainties associated with the existin. l'mited data base, 2) riot

1dientifying the range o# alternative interpretations and assumptions that can
be reascnably supporzeo by existing data, and 3) Aot incorporating a reasonable
range cf uncertainties and alternative interpretatIons Into evaluations and
conclusions.   Based on the above we believe that some conclusions in the final
EA's are s:i2 cverly favorable or optimistic for the areas of ccwment.
In accordance ~iith our review plan, the NRC staff also reviewd aspects of the
?lethodolooy Document.  As mentioned earlier the NRC staff cId net evaluate the
ranking of the sites or the ranking methodolog.v itself.  4ust as was done fcr
 he dra~t EA's, the review focused cn the existIng data and how that data was
used in the evaluations in the final LA's and the Methodology Document.    From
this review it was clear that evaluations and conclusions regarding site
conoitions presertia in the final LAs were factored into the evaluations of
sce~rlos and their consequences presented in the I~ethodoloqj Document.
Therefore, conclusions on repository performance in the Methodology Doctm'ent
that were derived from evaluations and conclusions in the final EA's, that are
cunsioered in our coew~eaats to be overly optimistic, are lkswise considered to
be overly optimistic.   Some examples for the Hanfcrd Site are ~) insuffIc~~n~
ccnsiderat!cn of flow along large. dIscrete faults and fracture zones that may
exist within dense flow interiors, including consideration of fracture flow as
~n  unexpected   `eature rather than an "expected  one, and ~) `nadeovate
consideration of alternative assumptions regarding pumping for the sui~all-scale
exploratcry drilling scenario.   Some factors which were not giver ~ufficient
consideration for the salt sites are 1) effects of host rock mass
hetercgenelties and 2) shaft and repo~'tory sealing concerns related to
:herw.alTy inducted salt creep and differential uplift.   An example from tfle
YL*Cca 1*~ountair Site is the lack of consideration that hydrothe~al activity
eculd be a future source of fluid important to waste package corros~cn.    For
J   sttes, t~e effects of alternative corrosion mechanisms were not faczor,d
~nto waste package l,fetime anal"ses.   Finally, consiuer'rg the examples noted
~bcvc,   it is overly ootlmlstic to state on p.  -41 of the Methoco~ogy Document
that ~`.4~en olace~ c~ a scale where a zero c~r~ be interpreted as per'o~ance at
the miri~um lev&    equired b~  the pri~ar"-contair~nent reouire~ents of the E?A
sZa~c~rds and :cc ~s perf~ct~on, all of :~e sites have expected utilities of
99.7 cr higher.'
