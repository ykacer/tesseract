Dear Ronald:

WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS!

The U.T. Graduate School of Business Career Services Office has alreadY
started planning for the Class of   `95. As a prospective member of that
class, we would like to inform you of the programs we offer to assist
our students with their job searches.   Below we've outlined just a few
of the Graduate Career Services Office programs for Fall   `93.
* Career Strategies Series - brings in a variety of distinguished
lecturers to discuss the changing staffing needs of business and
industry as welL as job search techniques.
* "Job Shops" - students with similar career interests working as a
group with the guidance of a career counselor to develop self-marketing
strategies specific to their group's job search needs.
* Employer Reference Service - personalized program to find contact
information for companies of interest to you and instruct you in the
best use of available resources for your own job search.
* Personal Career Counseling - a staff of professional,   trained career
counselors are available to give you individual assistance with resumes,
cover letters, career choice and job search.
* Resume books, panel presentations, on-campus recruiting, workshops,
alumni and peer networking resources,  resume referral, a business career
library, and much more!

As you can see, we are interested in making your job search an effective
and productive one.  Because of this, we are constantly developing and
evaluating new resources to meet the specific needs of each class.    We
expect every graduate studenL to take an active role in our existing
programs as well as in the development of new ones.    We look forward to
your participation in these activities as a new MBA or MPA.    For your

forward to working with you soon!
