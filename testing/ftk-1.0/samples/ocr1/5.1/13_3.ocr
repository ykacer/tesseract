Board of Directors of the Austin Jaycees

Suite BiQO
Austin, Texas 78704

Dear Board Members

As many of you know, Ijust got ajob with Dell Computers. My job is in technical support
which operates on a 7 day a week, 24 hour phone coverage. I have discussed with our
President Jennifer Lopes my current work schedule at Dell. I have to work Saturday
through Wednesday 12:00 to 9:00 PM. This obviously conflicts with my Monday Board
and Membership meetings. Jennifer and I concur that at the current moment m time it
would be best that I drop my position as Public Relations Director so that another member
of the Austin Jaycees can be recruited to take over those important duties.

I still am very much involved with the Jaycees, and while the current work schedule at
Dell might not allow me to appropriately participate in my responsibilities as Director, I
will be available to help any of you in your projects whenever possible.

Sincerely

B~n~rd tTBrown
