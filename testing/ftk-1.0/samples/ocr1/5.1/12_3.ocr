Accidental accent ... Men's rights   Playing it safe ... The bores of summer

      Wee Ur Nut Makeen Zees Oop
After being injured in a car crash, a 46-year-old Massachusetts man
began speaking with a French accent-a victim of a rare neurological
disorder, Foreign Accent Syndrome. The syndrome, usually a result
of stroke or head trauma, results from damage to an area of the brain
involved in controlling the vocal chords, reports neurologist Majaz
Moonis of she University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worces-
ter. Still, much remains mysterious: Why, for example, a Prench ac-
cent? The patient had no French ancestry and the farthest he'd ever
ventured from his hometown of Worcester was a trip to New Jersey.

A Tough Habit to Kick "We have 434,000 deaths
each year related to cigarette smoking. It costs us an
average of $69 billion in increased health care costs
and time lost from work, and yet our government
continues to subsidize the cigarette industry. We
have to stop this." -Dr. M.Joycelyn Elders, Surgeon
General Desi~nare

Handy Men Although
breast tumors are equally
likely to occur on either side
of the body, left-breast tumors
are detected earlier, accord-
ing to Minneapolis surgeon
Leonard Schultz. That's be-
cause the tumors are picked
up by the women's husbands,
Dr. Schultz told Physician's
Weekly, "and most men are
right-handed."

Bored to Tears

Every year for the past
eight years something

called the Boring Institute
in Maplewood, N.J., has de-
dared July "National Anti-
Boredom Month." This
July the institute highlights
the role of boredom in a
variety of serious health

problems, from eating disorders, alcohol and drug
abuse to suicide. And what's one of the institute's
main recommendations? Turn off the TV! Maybe
this whole Boring Institute idea was a cute gimmick
for a year or two-three, tops-but by now it's be-
ginning to seem a little  well...
