Earthquake Occurrinn During Emplacement Operations

      This  combination  of  events  may impose significant  loads on   the
interface   between the transporter cask and the emplacement borehole. This
loading   will be  independent  of   other factors such as borehole filling,
radiation, and temperature.   To accomodate the load, it will be necessary to
design   the interface   with strength  sufficient to withstand the imposed
loads.    It will  also be necessary to design the transporter with reaction
supports adequate to ensure that the waste transporter moves in harmony with
the ground motion.  In addition, the E/R system will be designed so that any
adverse   effects resulting   from  ground movement during  emplacement or
retrieval can be rapidly mitigated.

Water Intrusion into a Filled Borehole

      It  is currently   planned that waste will not be emplaced in boreholes
where   water inflow  is   detected.   Water inflow after emplacement could
possibly    occur,  however,  if   a  perched reservoir is  replenished by
precipitation and subsequently recreates a dripping fracture that intersects
the emplacement borehole.   If such a combination of circumstances occurs, it
will   present no significant hazard during retrieval because the water will
be  vaporized  as  it encounters the boiling temperature isotherm around the
borehole   and will subsequently be driven into the rock or down the annulus
between   the liner and the borehole wall until it cools and condenses. This
does not alter the design basis for the liner environment because the design
basis already includes the presence of water vapor.

Conclusion

      Two points should be made regarding this discussion. The first is that
this   discussion is  not   intended  to lend credibility to the synergistic
scenarios   presented.   The second point is that the synergistic effects are
not   unique to  horizontal   emplacement; they are also present for vertical
emplacement  and  must   be  considered in  design for  either  emplacement
configuration.

      In summary, it is concluded that no significant adverse conditions will
develop   with the  horizontal  emplacement configuration due to synergistic
effects.
