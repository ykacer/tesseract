XX               ABSTRACT OF VOLUME.

CHAPTER VI: HISTORY OF BONNEVILLE BAsIN.-Previous to the Bonneville history the basin was
     arid.  The first rise of the lake was without overflow, and was long maintained; the Yellow Clay
     was then deposited. The second rise went 90 feet higher, causing overflow, but was of shorter
     duration; the White Marl was then deposited.    The final drying (livided the basin into a dozen
     independent basins, the largest of which contains Great Salt Lake.          Since l~45 that lake has
     repeatedly risen and fallen through a range of 10 feet.-The history of Lnke Bonneville is par-
     alleled by that of Lake Lahontan, and each is connected with a history of glaciation in adjacent
     mountains.  This connection, the depauperation of the fossil shells, and an analysis of the climatic
     conditions of glaciation, lead to the conclusion that the lacustrine epochs were epochs of relative
     cold.
CHAPrER VII: LAKE BONNEVILLE AND VOLCANIC ERUPTION. -The group of small craters and basaltic
     lava fields Iwar Fillmore, Utah, are closely related to the lake history.  Sonie eruptions took place
     beneath the water of the lake, others since its disappearance, and others again during the inter-
     lacustrine epocl.-Numerous basaltic eruptions occurred in the lake area before the lake period,
     and at still earlier dates rhyolite was extravasated.
CHAPTER VIII: LAKE BONNEVILLE AND DIASTRoPHIsM.-Orogenic change during a Period subsequent
     to the lake is shown by fault scarps.   The formation of fault scarps is accompanied by earth-
     quakes.-Epeirogeuic change during a period subsequent to the lake is shown by the deformation
     of the planes of the shore-lines.  Under the p~stiilate that the doming of the planes is due to the
     drying away of the lake, it is conclu& that the strains induced by the unloading of the areas
     exceeded the elastic limit of the material and caused viscous distortion of the earth's crust.
     This result, taken in connection with the phenomena of mountain uplift, leads to an estimata of
     the strength of the crust.
ChAPTE~ IX: AGE OF THE EQUUS FAUNA.-The Equns fauna at its type locality is contained in lake
     beds correlated by physical relations with the uppermost of the Lahontan and Bonneville beds,
     The fauna, previously called later Pliocene, is thus shown to have lived in late Pleistocene time.
