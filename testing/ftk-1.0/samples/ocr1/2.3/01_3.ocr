135  West Lonqitude.   A second data set of just the NTS area for the

time period 1969-1972 was obtained from U.S.G.S.    This set contained

seismic events detected and located usinq stations of the U.S.G.S.,

Sandia Laboratories,  Incorporated, and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory   local

seismoqraph networks.   A thii~d data set was obtained from the U.S.(~..S.

which cevored a section of central California along the San Andreas Fault

where they employ a dense network of seismoqraph stations.

     Perspective plots of the earthquake strain release for the California!

Nevada area were prepared for one-year periods between 1950 and 1973 and

for ten-year periods  19)3-1942 through 19b3-1972.   These plots represent

the cumulative strain release for each of 1,760 1/4    by l/4   qrid units

between 32.5    nd 42.Y North Latitude and 113.5    and 124.Y West Longi-

tude.  In an earlier report  (Willis and others.  1973). similar plots were

published for the Nevada area extendinq back to 1852.    Trends of earti;t'uake

activity are clearly visible on these perspective plots but no pattern of

migration could be detected in the seismic activity.    Nor could short term

increases or chanqes in seismic activity be detected beyond the NTS area

that would correlate with the NTS testing proqra.9'.

     Cross-correlation of the 1956 strain release data   (a year which

contained no significant underground nuclear tests)  with the strain

release data for  ,ach year between 1950 and 1973 indicated a reoccurrence

every 5 to 6 years of high niaxii"um correlation coefficients.  This may

be due to the reoccurrenc" of one or more major earthquakes in the same

qrid unit.   As with the visual analysis, no correlations were observed

with the NTS dctivity.
