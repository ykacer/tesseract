Instant divorce
law struck down
An Associated Press Report
   NEW DELHI, India - A
court has struck down a law
that lets Muslim men In India
divorce their wives by re-
peating a single word, ruling
that the centuries-old tradi-
tion is unconstitutional and
denigrates women.
   The order by. the Allah-
abad High court in the north-
ern state ~t Uttar Pradesh
was the first legal setback to
the Muslim tradition allowing
men to divorce by saying,
"Talag. talaq, talaq," which
means divorce in Arabic.
   There . are no nationwide
figures, but, clerics say most
divorces among Indlas 100
million Muslims occur this
way.
   The ruling Friday came
in a case brought bY a di-
vorced Muslim woman in a
property dispute. It was a
boost to India's growing Mus-
lim  feminist movement,
which will, likely press on
with its demand for changes
in divorce laws.
