AUTOMOTIVE

Na, this is nato trick photo. Micrecars start smalL and in their sporty derivatives, get even smaller.
The tiny size is prompted by Japanese regulations aimd at saving space.

       MIRocARs
 URBaNE Assaucr VEHICLE
Before you even ask, the answer is
   no. No, you cannot buy the new
   660-cc, DOHC, three-cylinder, in-
tercooled, turbocharged Mazda AZ-i
in the United States, even if you could
afford its $14,000 sticker price. The
plastic-bodied, bumperless micro-rock-
et would never meet U.S. crash safety
requirements, and tweaking its 64-
horsepower engine to pass our emis-
sions standards would erode the AZ-i's
40-mpg rating. But that didn't stop us
from throwing the mid-engine coupe
into Manhattan traffic to judge the
Japanese definition of an urban
assault vehicle.
 City vehicles need to accelerate
quickly, stop quickly, and feature good
mirrors. The AZ-i scored well in all
three departments. Acceleration off
stop lights was brilliant, especially
when the turbo kicked in with a
scream at around 3,000 rpm. Four-
wheel disc brakes quickly checked the
1,587-pound car's excess speed and
the mirrors gave an ample view of the
New York traffic around us. Steering
was nimble and sure. Japan-market
city cars are, in some ways, an urban
commuter's dream.
 The AZ-i failed on two key points,
however. Potholes ingested its little
13-inch wheels and strained the four-
wheel independent suspension; also,
the car's cute appearance and gull-
wing doors drew crowds anywhere it
was parked. That suggests it would
also attract thieves.

 At just less than 11 feet long, the
car had no parking problems in New
York. And it magically swallowed a
six-foot-tall test driver and a six-foot-
three-inch photographer. Getting in
and out of the car, however, required
the agility of a gymnast.
 A worthy road warrior? You bet. But
one you won't soon see in midtown
rush hour traffic.-Sandy Fritz

       EMissioNs
  LEAN Cw Licics NOx
Wider use of fuel-efficient lean-
     burn  engines has been
     stymied by a major problem:
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. As
fuel mixtures get leaner, exhaust gas-
es become oxygen-rich. Excess oxygen
makes it difficult for current catalysts
to deoxidize NOx. For carmakers with
lean-bum engines, an effective NOx
catalyst has been the Holy Grail.
 Mazda claims to have found it-at
least a version adequate for the
Japanese market. The company re-
cently announced a three-way catalyst
that removes hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from
lean-bum engine exhaust.
 The catalyst is based on the mineral
zeolite, which is coated with a precious
metal Mazda won't identify The com-
pany says it has conlirrned the durabil-
ity of the new catalyst in bench tests.
 For drivers, the benefit is fuel effi-
ciency. The Mazda catalyst allows
lean-bum operation over a wider range
of driving conditions than current lean-
bum engines, boosting fuel economy
from 5 percent to 8 percent.
 The new catalyst does not yet meet
California's strict NOx limits, however.

         CADILLAC's
       Nw CRUUER
It's big~ make no mistake about it. At 210
 inches long and 3,998 pounds, Cadillac's
 Deville Concours, new far 1994, Is three
inches longer and 400 pounds heavier than
lostyom's Devil..
 The new Deville has mostof the hallmadcsof
the typical large American luxury cruiser. But not
quite all. Installed beneath this Caddy's brand
hood is the Northstar V8 engine, until now of.
fered only in the Seville and Eldorado Coupe
and the discontinued Aliont4. This variant of
Cadillac's double-overhead-cam, 32-valve en-
gine develops 270 hp at 5,600 rpm and 300
pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm sufficient,

sedan to 60 mph in about eight

seconds.
 Concours has the

rest of the
Northstar
system"
as well,
induding

independent front and rear suspension, electron-
Ic damping~ and speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion
steeling. Those undeipinnings allow Cadillac en-
ginee~s to pull off o real sleight-of-hand: In gate
of      thp(onceia~handles like a true
sports sedan, with precise steering and raad feel
and an isolated yet controlled ride. It's fast and
   ckstoth~rood, wlthnone of the soft, wal-
lowing sen~itIens of Cadwioc's post efforts.
  Two details keep the Concours out of the true
sports sedan doss: Instead of front bucket seats
and a console, there~ obench seat far three
passengers in front,. a feature Cadillac says its
buyers demand. And the instrument cluster is
digital, with no analog display available.
