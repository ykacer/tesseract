Cisneros' high aim for HUB
After a year on job, secretary finds reach exceeds grasp

   WASHINGTON - Henry Cis-
neros likes dramatic gestures.
   When a homeless woman died
outside the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, the HUD
secretary appeared at her funeral.
When the Ku Klux Klan threatened
black residents of a Texas housing
project, Cisneros seized control of
the local housing authority to force
integration. When an earthquake hit
Los Angeles, Cisneros dashed to the
scene and stayed for two weeks.
   No one is saying the drama is
meaningless. Even Cisneros' harsh-
est critics, who accuse him of show-
manship for political gain, concede
that the 46-year-old former mayor of
San Antonio seems to mean well.
But, by most accounts, what he has
accomplished in a little over a year
still falls far short of his goals.
   Cisneros says it is too early to
judge him. His critics are skeptical
that he will ever live up to his goals -
in part because his approach is
sometimes inefficient and in part be-
cause his aims are so ambitious as to
be unachievable.
   Consider Cisneros' reaction
when he walks by a panhandler.
Against the advice of experts, Cis-
neros conceded in a recent interview,
he reaches into his pocket for
change.
   "I know that some may be using
that for alcohol or other substance
abuse," Cisneros said. "But if I can
help others, then I don't mind."
   Cisneros has set reducing the
number of homeless people on the
streets as his top priority. He reels
off his five lesser priorities: improve
public housing, expand opportunities
for private housing, combat housing
discrimination, empower poor com-
munities to develop economically
and reform HUD's management
style.
   In the Clinton Cabinet, Cisneros
has taken the role of champion of the
underdog, which critics argue has let
other Cabinet members off the hook
too easily. His colleagues respect his

Reno, Cisneros is the Cabinet mem-
ber who most seems to delight in
rubbing elbows with the public. Like
the president, Cisneros enjoys both
"town hall" meetings and one-on-one
chats. He knows the art of listening.
  Friends of the secretary say all
the outreach leaves little time for a
private life. Cisneros tries hard to
spend some evenings at home with
his wife, Mary Alice. His 6-year-old
son, John Paul - named after the
pope - recently underwent major
heart surgery.
  Cisneros' decision to attend the
funeral of Yetta Adams, the woman
who died on HUD's doorstep in De-
cember, was characteristic of his at-
tempts to rekindle a feeling of ur-
gency about a social problem. The
president has left the homeless issue
almost exclusively to Cisneros, al-
though Clinton's budget would dou-

   "This is a new day," Cisneros de-
clared, vowing that if necessary he
would summon federal marshals to
protect future black tenants.
   Cisneros and his assistant secre-
tary for fair housing, Roberta Ach-
tenberg, won praise from civil rights
groups for conceding that racial dis-
crimination within the public housing
system is rampant. By contrast, dur-
ing the Bush and Reagan years,
HUD denied bias in dozens of court
battles. The agency is now likely to
settle most of those suits, Achten-
berg said.
   In other areas, such as fixing up
its public housing and fostering eco-
nomic development in poor neigh-
borhoods, critics say HUD is a long
way from offering solutions.
   Last week, Cisneros outlined re-
forms designed to eliminate or con-
solidate 59 HUD programs. He also
vowed to let local housing officials
use modernization funds to replace
run-down public housing units with
new units - a financing tool that
could rid the country of some of its
worst public housing high-rises.
   Cisneros has also committed
himself to continuing former HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp's program to
sell public housing units to tenants.
But in many developments, HUD is
still a slumlord. At the same time,
families may wait years for a public
housihg unit or a rent subsidy. In
1993, HUD had only 10.6 million
units to meet the needs of an esti-
mated 14.3 million people.
   Michael Kane, director of the
Boston HUD Tenant Alliance, is
skeptical of the plan to decentralize
HUD - a pet idea of Cisneros'. "The
career bureaucracy is not going to
change," Kane said.
   Yet in an interview Cisneros in-
sisted that "reinventing HUD is very
real." He grabbed a a pen and
sketched a pyramid representing the
distribution of the agency's 13,500
employees. Then he turned the
sketeh upside down to show how
power would shift to workers in the
field.
