Donald Swann; Half of Flanders
and Swann Musical Comedy Act

   Donald Swann,   whose impish
 demeanor and owl-eyed expres-
 sions made him the more outgoing
 half of the jocular team of Flanders
 and Swann, has died in London.
   The Associated Press on Friday
 quoted a family spokesman as say-
 ing he had died Wednesday in a
 London hospital. Swann was 70
 and fighting prostate cancer.
   Best known for their eccentric
 revues of the 1950s and `60s-"At
 the Drop of a Hat" and "At the Drop
 of Another Hat," Michael Flanders
 and Swann paid homage in song
 ~and verse to unusual themes.
 * A perennial favorite ode was to a
 hippopotamus:
   "Mud, mud, glorious mud, there's
 nothing quite like it for cooling the
 blood."
   They also celebrated wart hogs,
 the London bus system, the gnu
 and the armadillo. An added touch
 was that they sang of these non
 sequiturs in several languages, in-
 cluding Greek and Latin.
   Their blend of odd humor and
 biting satire made  them world
 favorites until Flanders' health
 failed.
   Because of childhood polio, he
 used a wheelchair and gave up
 * touring in 1967. Flanders died in
 1975.

  Swann had been the bemused
pianist of the act, performing the
Flanders-Swann  repertoire with
an expression on his face that
indicated he might be slightly daft.
  The bearded and more subdued
Flanders sat at his side in his
wheelchair offering up jokes that
Swann found more hilarious than
they sometimes were. Many times
Swann was the object of Flanders'
derision.
  Swann was born in Wales, but
was  half-Russian and grew  up
speaking the language.
  He performed in theatrical re-
vues  at Christ Church  College,
Oxford. A conscientious objector,
he returned to Oxford after World
War II where he performed refu-
gee  relief work in  the Middle
East.
  There he teamed with Flanders,
the lyricist for the two.
  Flanders and Swann first won
fame in 1956 with "At the Drop of a
Hat," which ran for more than
1,700 performances  in London's
West End and on Broadway for
more than 200 performances.
  After the partnership ended,
Swann continued to compose but
never regained his popular success.
  He wrote an opera, "Perelan-
dra," song cycles and cantatas and
dozens of instrumental works.
  Survivors include his wife, Au-
son, and two daughters.
