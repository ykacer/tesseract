Figure 2-4  A glaciological reconstruction of the North
American ice cover between 21,000 and 17,000 BP. A single
Laurentide dome is postulated over Hudson Bay because
postglacial isostatic uplift is greatest there, but the bed was
frozen beneath this dome because few, if any, erratics of
Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from Hudson Bay are found on
the surrounding Precambrian crystalline shield along the ice
divide. Ice streams are shown occupying the fore-deepened
interisland channels on the Arctic continental shelf and in
the ring of elongated lakes radiating from Hudson Bay and
located along the outer boundary of the shield. Floating ice
tongues and ice shelves may have formed beyond ice streams
occupying interisland channels. The extension of a grounded
portion of the Arctic Ocean ice-shelf cover onto northern
Alaska is entirely hypothetical, as discussed in Chapter 8.
Grounded ice lobes and ice fans formed beyond ice streams
occupying elongated lakes. Ice shelves probably became par-
tially grounded as they passed over sills in the narrow straits
between Baffin Island and Greenland, Greenland and Ice-
land, Iceland and the Faeroes, and the Faeroes and Scotland.
The southern Laurentide margin had a surface equilibrium
line separating an inner accumulation zone from an outer
ablation zone; the northern margin did not, except where
katabatic winds flowed down ice streams and into fiords. A
basal equilibrium line separating an inner melting zone from
an intermediate freezing zone was located about midway
across the Canadian Shield, and a second basal equilibrium
line separating the intermediate freezing zone from an outer
melting zone was located near the surface equilibrium line
along the southern Laurentide margin. The present divides
of the Hudson Bay and Grear Lakes watersheds are the ap-
proximate locations of these~two basal equilibrium lines (see
Chapters 5 and 6). Innuitian and Greenland domes are also

shown, together with minor domes over Nova Scotia, New-
foundland, Devon Island, Iceland, and elsewhere. The Cor-
dilleran ice divide probably had several domes. Ice-free areas
existed on the headlands between fords, particularly in Baf-
fin Island and Greenland; and on the lee side of islands
separating ice streams, such as Banks Island. The pattern of
flowlines and basal thermal conditions shown is the one used
for tbe single-dome maximum Laurentide ice sheet recon-
struction in Chapter 6. Key: Thick solid lines are ice-sheet or
ice-cap margins, thick dashed lines are ice-shelf grounding
lines, thin solid lines are surface flowlines on grounded ice
sheets or ice caps, and thin dotted lines are their extensions
on~floating ice shelves. Areas covered by large dots have
thawed or partially thawed beds, with thawed beds beneath
ice streams and partially thawed beds in zones of basal melt-
ing or freezing (the density of large dots is qualitatively pro-
portional to the degree of ice-bed uncoupling due to thawed
basal conditions). Areas covered by small dots denote sea ice
extent (the density of small dots is greatest along sea-ice
margins). Black areas are open seas beyond the ice-sheet
marine margins, and white blocks scattered in the black areas
represent tabular icebergs calved from these margins (partic-
ularly from ice shelves and where calving bays are migrating
up surging ice streams). Horizontal ruled lines along terres-
trial ice-sheet margins show sectors bordered by proglacial
lakes (no attempt is made to show the areal extent of these
lakes). Heavy broken lines in Figure 2-4 show the approxi-
mate inner and outer boundaries of the Canadian Shield.
Outlines of ice sheets are adapted from Figure 2-2, with
arbitrary ice borders drawn in places where Figure 2-2 lacks
information. Ice shelves are entirely hypothetical and there-
fore were not depicted in Figure 2-2; the possibility that such
ice shelves existed is discussed in Chapter 8.
