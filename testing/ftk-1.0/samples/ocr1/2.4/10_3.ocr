House rejects bid
for spending cuts

Congressional Quarterly

  House lawmakers Thursday
narrowly rejected 202-216 an at-
tempt to put the House on record
as supporting Senate-approved
language calling for additional
spending cuts over the next five
years.
  The House and the Senate
have already approved their re-
spective versions of the fiscal 1995
budget blueprint. The key differ-
ence between the two versions is
that the Senate version includes an
additional $26.1-billion in spending
cuts over five years.
  House and Senate conferees
will now meet to agree on a com-
promise version of the budget
plan.
  Advocates of increased deficit
reduction, led by Timothy J. Pen-
ny, D-Minn., and John R. Kasich,
R-Ohio, had hoped to compel
House conferees to accept the
Senate spending cut.
  "Let's just say yes one time to
one spending cut, on a bipartisan
basis," said Kasich.
  Opponents of the Penny-Kasich
amendment argued that the Sen-
ate cut would take needed money
away from national defense, educa-
tion and criminal justice.
  Voting to urge House confer-
ees to accept $26-billion in spend-
ing cuts: Canady (R), Fowler (R),
Lewis (R), McCollum (R), Mica
(R), Miller (R), Ros-Lehtinen (R),
Stearns (R).
  Voting against: Bacchus (D),
Brown (D), Gibbons (D), Hutto
(D), Johnston (D), Meek (D),
Peterson (D), Thurman (D), Bili-
rakis (R), Goss (R), Young (R).
  * House upholds death
penalty: Liberal lawmakers suf-
fered a setback Thursday as the
House rejected a death penalty
substitute as part of the $ 15-billion
anti-crime bill.
  The amendment, which would
have replaced life in prison for all
crimes subject to the bill's death
penalty provisions, failed by a vote
of 111-3 14.
  While support for the amend-

ment came overwhelmingly from
Democrats, 149 Democrats op-
posed it. Six Republicans voted
yes. Amendment supporters ar-
gued that the death penalty costs
too much, fails to deter crime and
encroaches on state judicial over-
sight.
  But opponents said the death
penalty is the sternest conse-
quence for those who commit vi-
cious crimes.
  Other attempts to exempt fed-
eral crimes from the death penalty
also failed, and lawmakers ap-
proved amendments to make it
easier to impose the death penalty
on criminals. The House is expec-
ted to vote on the anti-crime bill
this week.
  Voting to replace the death
penalty with life imprisonment:
Meek (D).
  Voting to oppose: Bacchus (D),
Brown (D), Gibbons (D), Hutto
(D), Johnston (D), Peterson (D),
Thurman (D), Bilirakis (R), Canady
(R), Fowler (R), Goss (R), Lewis
(R), McCollum (R), Mica (R), Mill-
er (R), Ros-Lehtinen (R), Stearns
(R), Young (R).
  * Senate votes to restrict
desert development: After
eight years of on-and-off debate,
the Senate on Wednesday passed
69-29 a measure that would re-
strict development on a vast por-
tion of California desert and create
three new national parks.
  The bill, sponsored by Califor-
nia Democrat Dianne Feinstein,
would protect more than one-third
of the California desert's 25-mil-
lion acres. It is the largest land
protection measure considered by
Congress since the passage of the
Alaska Lands Act in 1980.
  Feinstein displayed numerous
pictures of the desert's unique fea-
tures in an attempt to convince her
colleagues that the bill would pro-
tect more than a vast, parched
space void of anything but sand.
  Voting to designate new wil-
derness areas in the California des-
ert: Graham (D).
  Voting against: Mack (R).
