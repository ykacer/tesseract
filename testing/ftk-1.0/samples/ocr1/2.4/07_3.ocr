 mations of this rock have been recognized    nd mapped
 by Messrs. Emmons and Garrey.       These formations are
 not necessarily individual flows.  Some of them are really
 parts of a single thick flow, and others are certainly com-
 posed of several flows.  Intercalated between the rhyo-
 lites are five flows of plagioclase basalt, one flow of
 quartz latite, some stratified tuffs, and finally capping the
 series, a flow of quartz-bearing basalt.    The effusive
 rocks are cut by intrusions of rhyolitic porphyry, plagio-
 clase basalt, and leucite basanite.   Most of the basalt
 dikes occupy fault fissures.
   The `I'ertiary lavas and tufts are generally conformable
 to one another, but at a few places slight erosional un-
 conformity has been detected.
   The entire series of volcanic rocks is divided by faults
 into a large number of blocks in each of which the flows
 are in general tilted to the east at angles up to 40~. The
 fault planes strike from northwest to northeast and dip
 generally to the west.   The (lisplacement as a general
 rule, is normal; that is, the hanging wall in each case
 has slipped down relative to the foot wall.    In conse-
 quence of this structure anyone traveling across the dis-
 trict from west to east will see the edges ~if the same
 flows repeated again and again in the successive western
 fronts of the ridges.
In regard to the veins they say:
   Most of the lodes are not simple veins, but are fissure
 zones (of nearly vertical dip) containing numerous vein-
 lets or stringers of vein material and in most cases show-
 ing no definite walls. The principal stringers are parallel
 with the sides of the lode as a whole, hut they are linked
 by numerous irregular cross veinlets, and similar small
 stringers extend for varying (listances into the country
 rock.  The lodes range in width from a few inches to 10
 or even 100 feet.
   Typical vein quartz, such as is characteristic of the
 gold veins of the Appalachians or Sierra Nevada or such
 as is ~ound in the pre-Tertiary schists of the Bullfrog
 district, does not occur in the mines near Rhyolite, with
 the exception of the Original Bullfrog.    The quarts is
 prevailingly fine grained, often of a porcelain-like tex-
 ture, and is usually intercrystallized with calcite.
