4 x 100-meter relay team. Cornerback
James Trapp, a third-round draft choice,
was an alternate on that same relay team.
And maybe there'll be Ismail, who can
hang with any of these guys.
  It's a freakish team. "There are lots of
fast football players," says Gault. "It's be-
come a speed game. But there's speed
and there's elite speed. As far as elite
speed, tbe league's got about a dozen
such players. We have half of them."
  This is not necessarily an advantage. Of
those six, only Gault and McDaniel have
made any kind of impact. But, as far as
Davis is concerned, speed is the way to go.
  Growing up in Brooklyn, Davis was in-
trigued by both the Yankees and the
Dodgers. "The Yankees had power, size,
and created fear," he says. "The Dodgers
believed in speed and in development;
they were willing to take chances. For the
Raiders, I wanted both. I never could un-
derstand why you couldn't have both.'?
  Speed means big plays and sudden
strikes that demoralize opponents with
their swiftness. Having speed puts tre-
mendous pressure on defenses. Davis be-
lieves that his sprinters don't have to
catch the ball to be dangerous. Their pres-
ence is electric enough to alter a game's
dynamics, moving the defense off the line
and  creating space for   an  offense.
"Speed," says Davis, "is an integral part
of fear. As you know, we've always said
we'd rather be feared than respected."
  Davis was The Citadel's chief recruiter
in 1955, when he landed an All-America
sprinter out of Philadelphia named Ange-
lo Coia. Coia enjoyed a seven-year career
in the NFL and, not at all incidentally,
is now a scout for the Raiders. The bias of
the personnel department toward
speed-Kent McCloughan, a former
Raider cornerback, is another scout who
was a high school All-America in track-
is as natural as it is mandated. To this day,
part of a Raider scouting report is a work-
up on the player's high school track
experience.
  This emphasis doesn't always pay off.
Bo Roberson was a silver medalist in the
1960 Games in the long jump, and al-
though Davis kept him on the Raiders for
four seasons, he is not remembered as
having been anything more than a "com-
plement" to the offense. Jimmy Hines,
one of those sensational sprinters that
came out of Texas in the `60s, was picked
up by Davis even though his nickname
was Ooops! and two other teams had

dropped him. In the end, Davis could find
no better use for Hines than to fly him to
camp every Wednesday, dress him, report
him to the league as being there for a try-
out and use him during one practice to
challenge his cornerbacks. "You could do
that back then," says Al LoCasale, Davis's
longtime assistant. Well, the Raiders
could.
 But what do you say then of Cliff
Branch? He was an Olympic-level sprint-
er who languished until the fourth round
of the 1972 draft before Davis's scouts fi-
nally pulled the trigger. "Took two years
to get him ready," says Davis. Branch
ended his career with 501 catches, second

only in Raider history to
Fred Biletnikoff, a more
stolid receiver, something
that Davis was always sure
to have as well.
 Gault was not a project.
Despite his track creden-
tials he was first and fore-
most a football player. His
first year out of Tennessee
was one of his best as a pro.
He caught 40 passes for
836 yards for the Chicago
Bears,  who had drafted
him in the first round.
 McDaniel, an All-Pro
cornerback, is another
player who was never much

of an experiment. Initially a wide receiver,
he was converted to defense his sopho-
more season at Tennessee. He ended up
becoming an All-America and the Raid-
ers' first-round draft choice in 1988.
 Others, though, either by their nature
or their experience, are track men who
are under development. Graddy, yet an-
other Vol, insists he is a football person
but admits the sheer lack of repetitions
has handicapped him. In fact, he only
made the Tennessee team as a walk-on.
And despite subsequently breaking the
world record in the 60-yard dash, he
couldn't shake loose for more than three
catches his senior year. The Denver Bron-

Wright, the NFL's Fastest Man,
and Jeff (belowl, a gold medal-
1st, didn't find many open lanes.
