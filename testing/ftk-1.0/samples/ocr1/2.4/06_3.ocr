Determination of the Equation for Silica
Mass Transfer in Rainier Mesa
       Experiment 3 established that the rate of mass trans-
fer of the constituents from Rainier Mesa glass is dependent
on the reactive surface area to water volume ratio, a, in
addition to temperature.  The average total surface area of
the glass samples used' to determine the kinetic rate was
93.6 square meters.   If this value, along with the rate
constant obtained for the temperature of the rock and the
value of b given in Table 4 are used in equation 8, the
equation of mass transfer of silica into the groundwater of
Rainier Mesa is obtained:         -       -

Relationship for Rainier Mesa Groundvaters
       If Rainier Mesa precipitation is assumed void of all
silica (Freeze and Cherry, 1979) ~0 equals 0.0, and equa-
