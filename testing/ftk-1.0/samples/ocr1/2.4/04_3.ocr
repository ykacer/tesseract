  HOLLYWOOD, Fla. - The Con-
federate battle flag that flies over
Y9ung Circle here is once again
.c~sing a flutter.
  A group of workers from the
city's Sanitation Department want
~ flag taken down because it's
offensive, they say.
  Led by employee Michael Towns,

   sanitation workers sent a letter
asking city officials to remove the
sag.
  "That flag means exploitation
and injustice," said Mr. Towns, 33.
`11 a person wants to put the flag on
his car, house or boat, that's their
problem. But I don't think a city
should be displaying it. I'd like to
know why this city is still holding
into that flag."
  9uithele Ruiz, director of the Of-
*ce of Equal Opportunity and Affir-
mative Action for Hollywood, said
that Mr. Towns' request will be ad-

dressed at a  special meeting
Wednesday.
  "We've had a growing number of.
people express concerns about the
flag in the past few weeks," Mr. Ruir
said. "We hope this meeting will
bring a resolution."
  Mr. Ruiz said that members of
the city's African American Adviso-
ry Council will also be at the meet-
ing so they can make a recommen-
dation to the City Commission on
the issue. Commissioners have the
final say on the flag's fate.
  Mayor Mara Giulianti said she
would support removing the flag.
  The flag was hoisted in April
1990 over Young Circle on the re-
quest of veteran Bill Locke of Holly-
wood.
  The flag was removed from the
park in January 1990 after city offi-
cials were bombarded with com-
plaints that it was a racist symbol.
  Mr. Locke, who could not be
reached for comment, persuaded
commissioners to raise the flag be-
cause of its historic value. The
flag's 13 stars mark the secession of
11 Southern states - including
Florida - from the United States in
1860 and 1861, as well as the seces-
sion of governments in Kentucky
and Missouri.
  Mr. Towns credits his 82-year-old
grandmother for stirring up the is-
sue again.
  "I had parked at Young Circle
recently and left my grandma in
the car while I went across the

street to a store," Mr. Towns said.
"When I came back, Grandma was
tipset. She pointed to the rebel flag
and told me it reminded her of her
father's death in Georgia in 1913 at
the hands of four men who had
draped the rebel flag across their
wagon."
  Mr. Towns said his grandmoth-
er's story moved him to write the
letter to the city. He was backed by

several black employees in the
city's Sanitation Department, as
well as part-time city employee Ken-
neth Walton, a recreation leader at
Washington Park.
  "This is terrible," Mr. Walton
said, referring to the flag. "That
flag is an insult to all black people."
