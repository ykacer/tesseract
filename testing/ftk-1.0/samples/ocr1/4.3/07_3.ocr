remains free  to move  in a direction parallel   to a line with inclination `I'.

SLIDE  [master slave . cfl, cf2, cf 3]


     This card specifies   the master/slave connection for any slidelines     in

the analysis.    A maximum of  12 slidelines   is allowed.


master-   Number of  the boundary   flag id.   for the slideline master   side

slave-    Number of  the boundary   flag i.d.  for the slideline  slave  side

cf 1-     Value of  the  friction coefficient.   if fully  fixed use -1.

          Otherwise  insert  the proper value here.   ~O.

cf2-      Value of  slideline overlap tolerance to determine when contact      of

          surfaces does   occur42% of   the Master element   side length~

cf3-      Value of  stress  for release of   slave node  from master surface.
          Value  is set  to no release,a non-zero value    is required to activate

          this option.   ~Oj
