R)    Retention factors

      The  variation  of  the  retention   factors with  distance  is
      expressed in analytic form R - G+H * ~h)
                                            t
      where the  constants  are given  in  the tables  below for  the
      two  sets of  retention  factors  for which  calculations  have
      been made.

Case 4 a

This  case  is  based  on  the basic  set  of parameter  values  from
case  1 but with a lateral dispersion added.
