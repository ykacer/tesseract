   Since the parts of the Permian Basin in western Kansas and Texas and in
eastern Colorado end Mew Mexico had b..n screened as part of an earlier site
evaluation for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). this screening focused
on five subbasins:  the Anadarico. Palo Oura. Dalhart. Midland. and Delaware
Basins.  AU contain salt beds of adequate thic3m.55 and depth.  A site had
already praviously been selected in the Delaware Basin as a site for the WIPP
facility for the storage of radioactive defense wastes (DO!. IBSOb).   The Palo
Duro and the Dalhart Basins had far less potenti.al for oil and gas production
and have not been penetrated as extensively by drilling as have the Anadarico
and the Midland Basins.   Therefore, the Palo Durm and the Dalhart Basins were
7udged to be preferable to the other three and ware recoinndad for further
studies at the area stag. (0MW!. l983b).  These t'eo basins rated higher on six
ma7or screening factors:   the depth and thiciasess of salt. seismicity. mown
oil and gas deposits, the presence of exploratory boreholes. and evidence of
salt dissolution.4

   More-detailed geologic and environmental studies of the Palo Duro and the
Dalhart Basins began in 1977. and screening criteria were daveloped to define
locations with favorable characteristics.  Six locations in parts of Deaf

flexibility in repository siting at specific locations, the n,mber of
borsholes at each location, population density. and land-use conflicts.  After
applying these criteria, the DOE decided to focim on the two locations that
had the greatust lilcalihood of containing a suitable site. one in northvestsrn
Deal Smith and southeastern Cldha. Counties and one in northcentral Swisher
County.  All other locations in the Palo Duro Basin were deferred from further
consideration (CMIII. l983a).  In (`enruary 1983. the DOE identified parts of
Deaf Smith County and Swisher County as potentially accsptab.@ sites afld
subsequently narrowed the size of the two sites to be considered at eacn
location (DOE. 1984c).4
