    SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina - A Brit-
  ish warplane was shot down yesterday on a
  NATO mission over the Muslim town of Gor-
  azde, and the U.N.-declared safe area ap-
  peared on the verge of falling to Bosnian Serb
  forces.
    As Serb forces rolled toward the city's cen-
  ter, artillery fire struck a local hospital, caus~
  ing a `large number of casualties," said U.NI
  spokesman Maj. Dacre Holloway.
    In response. U.N. officials warned the Serbs
  that airstrikes would be imminent unless they
  held their fire, Holloway said.
    When the Serbian assault did not stop,
  NATO pilots set out - but because of a low
  cloud ceiling and rain, the warplanes aborted
  the airstrike run before any bombs were drop-
  ped, he said.
    "The ultimatum remains in force," said U.N.
  military spokesman Maj. Rob Annink. "We will
  use force if they attack us. We will use force if  -
  they advance farther toward the town."
