 Sulfate-water isotope geothermometer indicates temperatures to 282'~C.
 rravertine deposits suggest reservoir temperatures may be lower.

~o surface discharge; small area altered by gases.   Two wells 152           1.88        0.35          146
 and 1313 m deep, maximum reported temperature of 1440c at bottom
 of shallower well.

Three shallow wells to 229 m with maximum reported temperature of            0.38        0.079         33
 1320C. One additional well of unknown depth drilled in 1974.


More than 13 wells ranging in depths from 73 to 2219 m; maximum              2.0         0.37          157
 reported temperature 2140C.  Springs became inactive after
 drilling of first wells in the early 1960s.  Na-K-Ca geothermometer
 gives 2460C and may indicate a deep source for the water.
 Geothermal fluid with a working temperature of 1540C is used
 commercially to dehydrate vegetables.

No surface manifestations.  Three wells, deepest 2.3 kin, sited by           7.2         1.78          750
 geophysical techniques; recorded temperatures over 2000C, two
 wells capable of total mass flow of more than 200,000 kg/hr.
 Geothermal fluids are chemically different from nearby Brady area,
 indicating a separate system.

Several springs with temperatures to 770C.  Low flow rates                   1.24        0.23          97
 (20 L/min) may have permitted extensive near-surface water-rock
 reactions which in turn may have adverse effects on the Na-K-Ca
 geothermometer.
