 riiis accounts  for the absence of    the Wood Canyon Formation and

 nost of  the Zabriskie    in plates of  the Titus Canyon fault.
            The eastern    limit of  pull-away of  the upper   limb dur-

 ing folding must    have been at or near the north-trending valley
 ~n the east flank of    Thimble Peak.    East of  that valley the Bo-

 nanza King  rests   In conformable stratigraphic succession on the

carrara   Formation.   Everywhere west and     northwest of that val-

 ley the Bonanza King    is faulted against older beds.

            Evidence concerning the age of      tit. folding with ac-

companying   lag faulting   is somewhat ambiguous.      Southwest of

Leadfield,   beds of  the Oligocene Titus Canyon Formation are

faulted against beds of the Bonanza King along some faults that

do not extend    into the  lower plate.    This might suggest that

folding and    faulting could  be at   least as  young as Oligocene.

Other bounding faults,     however, do extend through the upper

plate  Into the lower.     Because attitudes of Titus Canyon beds

In the fault   blocks are discordant with underlying Cambrian

beds,  dipping   In opposite directions on one block,       ii is i.-

probable that the beds were tilted at a common time during          fold-

ing and   lag-faulting.    Rather,   it is likely that the faults
