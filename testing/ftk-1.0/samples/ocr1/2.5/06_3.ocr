 The Comini55t~~ has carefully

included in the SO's. The CommIssion
~nunues to believe that such

 in reprd to the generalized concern
~at NRC should be involved in the site
selection process. It Is noted that the
NRC has played an important role in
this process and will continue to do so.
The sates under consideration foe
somanation have been the subject of
0ntinuOus aaiawiy by the NRC staff to
adeatafy Licensing issues at the earliest
possible stage. Available data are
esamined on a regular basis and site
spe~5c documents such as the
enviionaieotal assessments are carefully
reviewed. There are also activities
specified by the NWPA which afford the
NRC an opportunity to directly influence
the site selection process. These are
NRC concurrence an DOEs siting
guidelines and review and comments on
he site characienistion plans. NRC
expects that, under the EIS scopang
process pursuant to CEQ rules. DOE will
keep NRC fully and currently Informed
of its plane for implementaizon. We also
expect to review and comment on DOEs
scoping documents and sctivitles for
implementing NEPA in the repository
prop~a which are to be developed
pursuant to CEQ `tales, and to CotTLfliefit
on DUEs LIS.
 Thus. the Issue of concern In this
rulemaking Is sot whether the
Commission should be involved In the
DOE sue saeenlng and selection
proCess generally. It Is. more
specaflcally. the scope of the Information
to be included In the DOE submission.

The NWPA. while generally conforming
to the earlier NRC regulation. omitted
the provisions dealing with NRC review
of site selection matters. The
commission consuues this action as sit
IndicatiOn that the site selection issues
previously dealt with in Part uo were to

characterizatiOn reports and dealt with.
instead, in the environmental
assessments. Under the NWPA. the
Commission's role In the review of
DOE's site characterize tion plans Is to
determine whether they are appropriate
In light of the Commission's regulatione.
Attention will be directed toward the
adequate of the characterization of a
particular site: and this is different from.
and not dependent upon. the
considerations that led to the selection
of that site.
~SAoft Sinking

 Some comrnenters suggested that the
regulation should be amended to require
that DOE may not proceed to
characterize sites by sinking shafts until
NRC and State review and comment
upon the SO' are complete. One
commenter suggested that the regulation
be clarified to specify that completion of
NRC review is not a condition precedent
for shaft sinking. The Commission
spees with the cominenters who retard
NWPA as requiring that DOE defer the
sinking of shafts at least until such time
as there has been an opportunity for
pertinent comments on shaft sinking to
have be en solicited and considered by
DOE. As stated in the preamble to the
~ roposed rule. "The Commission
 lieves that Confess intended that
DOE should provide the plans
sufficiently far in advance so that
comments may be developed and
submitted back to DOE early enough to
be considered when shaft sinking
occurs, and all times thereafter." The
question. therefore. is not whether the
Commission apses with the ob~ective of
those commenters to defer shaft sinking
until after comments on the SOP have
been received by DOE. The issue.
rather. was whether the Commission
should include in Its own regulations an
Interpretation of the obligations of DOE
under the statute. The Commission has
concluded that It should do so. In the
Interests of fulfilling its owit
responsibilities more effectively. The
Commission has stressed the
Importance of evaluating alternatives to
major design features that are important
to waste isolation, see 10 CFR
60.21(c)(1)(ii)(D). and In the case of the
design and location of the shafts this
can only be done prior to their sinking. It
Is import ant to the Commission that the
comments which It may provide to DOE

with respect to shaft sinking be taken
Into account as the Department
proceeds.
 The Commission observes that the
Incorporation of this language into the
regulation should have no effect on the
repository program. If the established
working arrangements (including the
Procedural Apeement. 48 FR 51576.
described in the preamble to the
proposed rule) provide the anticipated
information exchange. NRC would in
fact be able to review and comment in a
timely fashion during DOE's early
planning processes on those issues that
may have a bearing upon DOE's
decision to proceed with, or delay. the
sinking of repository shafts. Moreover.
the Commission is aware that DOE itself
has indicated its intention to wait until it
has completed a review of comments
before proceeding to sink shafts.
d Simultaneous Promulgation of
AmendmentS

  Some commenters recommended that
 all revisions to Part 60 and Part Si to
 conform them to the NWPA should be
 promulgated simultaneously. In
 particular. they recommended that the
 revisions concerning N'EPA
 requirements accompany the revisions
 currently being promulgated. They
 believe that this would assure that a
 comprehensive and integrated approach
 is taken and any confusion regarding
 NWPA and NtPA requirements would
 be eliminated. They argue that much of
 Part 60 now rests on NEPA authority so
 that failure to include NEPA in the
 currently proposed revision casts a
 cloud over the Commissions view of its
 authority to carry out early site reviews.
  The Commission has not put off
 considering its obligations under NEPA
 as modified by the NWPA. In
 developing these changes to the
 regulation. the Commission has
 specxflca!ly conside?ed whether any
 procedures might be needed at the site
 screening or charactet~zatiOn s age. so
 as to assure that the Cornju'iicsao , would
 be able to meet its ultam~ie NTPA
 responsibilities. The Commission
 concludes that they are not.
  The Commission's Part Si regulations
 govern the Commission's
 responsibilities for conducting
 environmental reviews associated with
 Its licensing and regulatory functions.
 Section 121(c) of NWPA. 42 U.S.C.
 10141. clearly states that the
 requirements and criteria set forth in
 Part 60 relate to the Commissions
 responsibility under the Atomic E.'iergy
 Act and the Energy Reor~snaZa lion Act
 and do not require a NEPA EIS. The Part
