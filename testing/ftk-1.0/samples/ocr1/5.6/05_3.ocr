SLAIN IN CROSSFIRE I
- ON HIS BIRTHDAY'

Was waiting to shoot
hoops with his buddies

 By LINDA MASSARELLA
 and SANDY GONZALEZ
 A Bronx    man   cele-
brating his 29th birth-
day with friends was
killed   yesterday  -
caught in a crossfire be-
tween   feuding gangs,
police said.
 David Echevarria was
the 81st person shot by
random gunfire this year
  and the third in four
days, police say.
 His last words to his
girlfriend were: "I love
you.
 And, in a scene eerily
reminiscent   of   the
movie    "Ghost."  To-
masita   Carvallo  told

The Post she respond-
ed: "Ditto."
  Echevarria, a restau-
rant manager, was hav-
ing a beer with friends
in  a   playground  at
183rd Street and Ryer
Avenue in the Fordham
section at about 1 a.m.
  "He was listening to
music, waiting for his
turn   to play  basket-
ball," Police Sgt. An-
drea Herzberg said.
  Suddenly,   a   fight
broke out between two
gangs - and shots were
fired, she said.
  Echevarria   was  hit
twice in the head and
died instantly.
  "There were all these

shots all of a sudden,"
said a man who lives
across the street.
 "I didn't look out -- no
way,  I'm  not   that
stupid," he said.
 Echevarria  "was  a
good guy - he worked,
he stayed with his girl-
friend," said a friend,
Henry Gonzales.
 But, because it was
his birthday, Echevar-
na  "wanted  to  cele-
brate," Gonzales said.
 Carvallo  told  The
Post that Echevarnia
had gone downstairs to
play cards and came
back to their apartment
around midnight.
 "He was bored, he still
wanted   to do  some-
thing," she said.
 "So he went to play
basketball."
 That's when he told
her he loved her and

walked out the door.
 "I   just  want  him
back," she sobbed.
 Residents   say  this
wasn't the first time an
Innocent   victim was
killed by a stray bullet
in their neighborhood.
 "About 12 people have
been  killed   like this
over the past two or
three years," said ~O-
year-old Juan Rivera.
 "The   police  rstation
housel is just two blocks
from   here,   and  we
never see enough cops.
 "The neighborhood is
being   overrun   with
drug dealers," he said.
"How can we live like
this?''
 On Tuesday, Michelle
McKie,    a  14-year-old
honor student, lost her
eye after she was hit
outside her high school
in Queens.
 And on Sunday, Tessa
Warren was killed by a
stray     bullet  fired
through the window of
her    apartment    in
Brooklyn as a basket-
ball  fan  sprayed  the
area   with  bullets in
celebration of a Knicks
victory.
 "It highlights the gun
problem that we have
in this city and in this
country," Police Com-
missioner       William
Bratton said.
