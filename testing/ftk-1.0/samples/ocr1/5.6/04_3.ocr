STARS COME
FLOODING IN

Country singers roll up their sleeves to rebuild ravaged Midwest

BIG-HEARTED
Country stars are

donating their time and
sweat to boost the sag-
ging spirits of thousands
of disaster victims in the
flooded Midwest.
  "We're with you and
praying for you," singer
Tony Orlando shouted
over a loudspeaker, as he
and other celebs piled into
the back of relief trucks to
pass out much-needed
drinking water.
  Tony and fellow croon-
ers Andy Williams, Jim
Stafford, Gene Dove, Steve
Presley and violinist Sho-
ji Tabuchi flew into flood-
ravaged Des Moines, Iowa,
from Branson, Mo., to boost
the morale of residents and
pass out 157,000 gallons of
water trucked in on 15 trac-
tor-trailers.
  "We've had good luck
and been spared," said 62-
year-old Andy, who was
decked out in jeans and a
work jacket as he hugged
grannies and tots and au-
tographed water jugs. "I'm
from Des Moines  and
wanted to help. We'll do ev-
erything we can to lift spir-
its despite the weather."
  Tony ignored the pelt-
ing rain as he led relief vic-
tims in chorus after chorus
of Row, Row, Row Your
Boat while the others joked

with the locals and signed
water jugs, cardboard six-
packs and T-shirts.
   The  stars, including
rocker John Cougar Mel-
lencamp,  also  donated
bucks from their concert
tickets to disaster relief.
And superstar Willie Nel-
son is doing a benefit.
   "They're great sports,"
says Virginia Hartley, 48,
who giggled like a teen-
ager after handsome Tony
Orlando gave her a hug.
   "I worked all night, then
stood in the rain for two
hours to give him a T-shirt.
And I sang along when he
sang his hit Tie a Yellow
Ribbon `Round the Old Oak
Tree and Michael Row the
Boat Ashore."
   Gushed  Carolyn De-
Priest: "I'm soaked! But
seeing Andy Williams is
worth waiting for.
   "I've been without wa-
ter  for 12  days. I've
learned  to  do without
showers and we use wa-
ter from the downspouts to
flush the toilets."
   Says Julie Gifford, mom
of 7-year-old Dale, a cer-
ebral palsy victim: "This is
the thrill of a lifetime for
my son. He's had 22 op-
erations and when he's re-
covering, he loves listening
to Andy Williams music."
