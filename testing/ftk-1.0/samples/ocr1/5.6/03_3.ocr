`Supermax' home for feds'

 FLORENCE - Beneath 34-foot-high
guard towers, workmen are putting the
finishing touches on "Supermax," also
known as "the Alcatraz of the Rockies."
 This is the part of the federal prison
complex that will house the nation's most
notorious, most dangerous and most en-
dangered male prisoners.
 It is intended to augment or possibly
supplant the "maximum-custody" prison
in Marion, Ill., which in turn replaced the
federal penal island of Alcatraz, in the
middle of San Francisco Bay, in 1963.
 Because of the legendary heritage of Al-
catraz and, to a lesser degree, Marion, Su-
permax in Florence is already rich in folk-
lore, even though it won't open for several
more months.
 Warden Bill Story, 54, is anxious to dis-
pel what he calls the public's misunder-
standings about "U.S. Penitentiary/Ad-
ministrative Maximum,"   Supermax's
formal name.
 Contrary to popular belief, Story said,
most of the 556 prisoners at Supermax
will not be kept in their single-cot cells 23
hours a day. Nor will all its prisoners, of-
ten referred to as "the worst of the worst,"
be required to eat in their cells. And they
won't all be prohibited from attending re-
ligious services or other group activities.
 Individual cells in Supermax's "control
unit" will house 64 inmates 23 hours a day,
as will a separate 72-cell segregation unit,
which Story calls "a jail within a jail." In-
mates held in this rigid system of confine-
ment will be permitted one hour a day out-
side their cells to exercise.
 The other inmates will have access to
group activities and be permitted out of
their cells for anywhere from three to 12
hours a day.
 Supermax also will have four VIP cells
should it receive an inmate with extraor-

 Unlike Marion, where the worst prison-
ers are held in basement cells, all cells at
Supermax have windows. In Marion, cells

 Still, "you can never say this is escape-
proof, because that could come back to
haunt you," said Story.
