rejected for funding. At present we have no knowledge
what the effects of low-level radiation exposure may have
upon us. I've just mentioned two instances of national
and statewide unconcern for the public's health because
it raises some serious questions regarding a high-level
radioactive dump site in Nevada. And frankly, the term
