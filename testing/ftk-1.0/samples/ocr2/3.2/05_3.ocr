(3) northern, (4) Abandoned Wash, (5) eastern, and (6) western and (7) north-
western blocks.

    1.     Solitario Canyon Block.    This block is characterized by north-
        northeast-trending tectonic breccia zones as much as 30 m wide. These
        alternate with zones of closely spaced normal faults, 1 to 50 m apart,
        which have displacements from a few centimeters to as much as 250 m.
        Only representative faults can be shown on the geologic maps (Figure
        5) and on Figure 30. The dip of the faults generally is 60° to 70° W.
        (range: 35° to 80° W.), but several faults dip steeply eastward. The
        frequency and displacement of fault and breccia zones decrease north-
        ward toward the head of Solitario Canyon, where individual faults
        coalesce into a single 20-m-wide fault zone with less than 30 m of
        vertical displacement.    The easternmost of these faults, called the
        Solitario Canyon fault, forms the western boundary of the potential
        repository.    Attitudes of bedding and foliation planes defined by
        welded pumice fragments range from horizontal to steeply overturned.
        Nearly ail of the faults developed before deposition of the Rainier
        Mesa Member of the Timber Mountain Tuff (11.3 m.y. ago), but at least
        one fault along the southwest edge of the Site cuts Quaternary allu-
        vial deposits.

        2.     Central Block. A scarcity of large-displacement faults and a uniform
               5° to 10° eastward dip of beds characterize this block (Figure 5).
               Two north-northeast-striking normal faults of small displacement cut
               the block near Drill Hole Wash.    The easternmost of these can be
               traced approximately 2.5 km southward from the wash, where it splays
               into a series of north-northeast-striking faults. This fault has as
               much as 14 m displacement. The westernmost fault, which extends into
               the northern block, can be traced for approximately 1.5 km and has as
               much as 5 m of displacement. Fractures striking about N10°W to N20°W
               and dipping 80°SW are widespread. Other fractures striking north to
               north 20° east and dipping steeply northwest and southeast are present
               but less common. In the southern half of the block, normal faults,
               spaced 30 to 100 m apart and with apparent displacements of less than
               3 m, occur parallel to the northwest-striking fractures. Near the
