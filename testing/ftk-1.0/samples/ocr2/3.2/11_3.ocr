 2.3.2 Geoengineering

        Geoengineering properties are important in predicting the mechanical and
thermal behavior of the host rock; they include strength and deformability,
porosity, density, the frequency of fractures, heat conductivity, and in-situ
stress. A detailed discussion of the geoengineering properties of the Yucca
Mountain site can be found in Chapter 2 of the SCP/CD.

        The current data base for the geoengineering properties of the Topopah
Spring Member consists of the results of laboratory tests on core samples from
Yucca Mountain and both field and laboratory tests on similar tuff units in
the region. In particular, a field testing program in G-Tunnel at Rainier
Mesa on the Nevada Test Site (see Figure 2-2) has provided valuable informa-
tion. The G-Tunnel data came from a tuff that is considered a reasonable
analog for the proposed repository horizon at Yucca Mountain in many aspects,
including similar bulk, thermal, and mechanical properties. The current data
base was derived mainly from tests performed on small-diameter cores (about
2.5 inches). It consists of approximately 100 tests of thermal conductivity,
300 tests of thermal expansion, 75 mineralogical-petrological analyses, 700
measurements of bulk properties (porosity, density), and 350 tests of mech-
anical properties.

        The stratigraphic section at Yucca Mountain is composed of a sequence of
welded and nonwelded tuffs. Some units are devitrified, and some are vitric.
The portion of the Topopah Spring Member that has been selected as the poten-
tial host rock is moderately to densely welded and devitrified, with minor
amounts of lithophysal cavities. This unit is expected to have high strength,
to have adequate thermal conductivity, and to be relatively easy to excavate.
However, the characteristics that affect thermal and mechanical properties,
such as porosity, degree of saturation, and stress state are known to vary
both laterally and vertically. Consequently, the thermal and mechanical prop-
erties are also likely to vary. This variability must be taken into account
in evaluating the thickness and lateral extent of the potential host rock as
well as in designing the underground repository and the seals for shafts and
boreholes (see Chapter 3).

        The in-situ stresses measured at the Nevada Test Site and at Yucca Moun-
tain are low in comparison with the generally high strength of the host rock.
The stresses measured at Yucca Mountain are consistent with those of other
measurements in the region. Tunnels excavated in similar layered tuffs at the
Nevada Test Site remain stable with minimal ground support, requiring only
rock bolts and wire mesh; these tunnels are similar to the planned excavations
at Yucca Mountain in terms of overburden loadings, dimensions of openings, and
methods of excavation.

2.3.3 Hydrology

       An important feature of a repository at Yucca Mountain is its location in
the unsaturated zone--the zone between the surface of the land and the water
table. Generally, any water that is present in this zone is under less than
atmospheric pressure, and some of the voids in the rocks may contain air or
other gases at atmospheric pressure. At Yucca Mountain, this unsaturated zone
