WELL 5A

    Well 5A is in Yucca Flat at Nevada coordinates, central zone:
                                                   I

N. 738,361, E. 707,514. The well was completed in March 1951.

Figure 8 illustrates the well construction and the borehole lithology.
Drilling history and other construction and logging details can be
found in references 8, 11, 12, and 17, and in the U.S. Geological
Survey files at Lakewood, Colorado and Mercury, Nevada.

       Table 9 presents production, representative aquifer-test data,
and water levels in the completed well. The measured water levels
increase slightly through the period of measurement as do the specific
capacities. This may indicate that the well had been developing
slightly over the period. Unfortunately, the data are insufficient
to establish a trend.

       Table 10 presents the chemical, spectrographic, and radiochemical
analyses of water from well 5A. Figure 9a shows variations in major
constituents and specific conductance of water from well 5A. The same
irregularities in Na+, HCO~s + C~-, S(~4-, and specific conductance
occur for the period 1957-59 that are noted for well 5C (figure 13a).
As well 5A is only 3,500 feet south-southeast of well 5C, and with-
drawal from both wells through 1961 is similar (tables 9 and 13),
it is perhaps reasonable to observe somewhat similar effects in both
wells. Well 5A was completed, in part, in rock described in the
driller's log as conglomerate, whereas well 5C was completed in sand
and gravel. The similar chemistry, water levels, specific capacities,
