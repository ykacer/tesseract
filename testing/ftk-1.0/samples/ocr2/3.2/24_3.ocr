 1.      Volume I                      Intera~ency Coordination. The Draft refers to the
         2-11; 3-C-3;                  ProCedural Agreement on packaging certification
         3-C-4                         signed by the DOE and NRC (48 Fed. Reg. 51875,
                                       November 14, 1983) and refers to strengthened
         Volume II                     coordination with other Federal agencies,
         10-16 to 17                   including the DOT and FEMA. The Group believes
                                       that DOE should clarify how it will improve
                                       coordination with other Federal agencies and what
                                       issues will be addressed, e.g. inspections;
                                       prenotifications; insurance/indemnity; fees;
                                       emergency response; risk assessments; data
                                       collection; and cost/benefit calculations. For
                                       example, will there be a memorandum of under-
                                       standing with DOT and an updating of the Federal
                                       Radiological Emergency Response Plan? How will
                                       DOE, DOT and NRC coordinate research and
                                       development activities to address issues of common
                                       concern? How will DOE assure itself that it is
                                       aware of actions by other Federal agencies
                                       that affect DOE's responsibilities, e.g. NRC's
                                       and DOT's plans regarding changes in criteria
                                       for certifying casks and any program to engage
                                       in destructive testing of models or casks?
                                       The need for increased attention to these
                                       matters was highlighted by the May 17, 1984
                                       decision by an ICC Review Board in Docket No.
                                       37891S and ~elated dockets dealing with rail rates
                                       for hauling loaded and empty spent fuel casks.
                                       In the Group's view, the Review Board ignored
                                       the implications of its decision with respect to
                                       effective implementation of DOE's responsibilities
                                       under the NWPA. Finally, how will DOE help assure
                                       that electric utilities, cask vendors and carriers
                                       are kept advised of important developments
                                       affecting transportation that result from
_                                      interagency communications?

  2.      Volume I                      Generic Reviews of Transportation Issues.
          3-C-2                         It should be a fundamental objective of DOE's
                                        policy that important safety, environmental and
                                        economic issues affecting transportation be
                                        resolved in generic proceedings rather than
                                        being addressed in reviews of specific ship-
                                        ments. Efforts to require movement-specific
                                        analyses of the "need" for and safety of
                                        specific shipments are inconsistent with safe
                                        and efficient transportation in support of the
                                        operation of nuclear power plants and are a burden
                                        on interstate commerce. As a corollary of this
                                        principle, the range of discretion allowed for
                                        imposing requirements on individual shipments
                                        should be narrowly circumscribed and clearly
