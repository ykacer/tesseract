    HONG KONG -- The ceremonial
changing of the guard took place high
above Hong Kong harbor, in one of the
glass-enclosed aeries reserved for the
colony's business elite.
    Simon Murray, a feisty Scotsman in
the long tradition of British colonial
traders here, reluctantly handed
over his job last fall as managing
director of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.,
the venerable British merchant trad-
ing house, to Canning Fok, a low-
profile Chinese accountant from
Hong Kong.
    The switch on the 22nd floor of
Hutchison House ended a boardroom
debate about the company's direc-
tion and signaled a scramble among
tim powerful "hongs" to shed their
British veneer before China takes
over in three years.
    Since 1979, Hutchison, founded by
a colonial class that once banned
Chinese from its country clubs, had
been controlled by Hong Kong bil-
lionaire Li Ka-shing. Li, known for
his solid business ties with the com-
munist leadership in Beijing, wanted
H utchison to concentrate on its trade
with mainland China. Murray, al-
though bullish on China, pushed lo
maintain the company's business
connections with the West through
investments in Britain and Canada.
     Murray also presented another prob-
 lem: He supported the democratic re-
 forms proposed for Hong Kong by Brit-
 ish colonial Gov. Chris Patten, the
 bane of the Beijing regime.
     When the dust settled, Murray was
 out. For the first time in its history,
 [tutchison was to be managed by a
 Chinese executive. Unequivocally, the
 main business of Hutchison would be
 China. There would be no more ques-
 tion of supporting Patten's reforms.

    In terms of Hong Kong history, it
was a moment almost as significant
as the day more than 150 years ear-
lier when Capt. Charles Elliot of the
Royal Navy convinced the British
Empire that the rocky island might
be a good place to set up business.
    As the Hong Kong newspapers
noted with varying degrees of cele-
bration and alarm, usually depend-
ing on the language in which the
article was written, Simon Murray
was one of the last British "taipans."
    For more than a century, the Hong
Kong financial world has been domi-
,nated by a handful of British trading
houses. These are the "hongs" made
famous in recent years through the
best-selling James Clavell novels Tai-
pan and Noble House.           ·
    But with Hong Kong set to revert
,to mainland China in 1997, the days
of the British taipan and the colo-
nial-style hong are coming to an end.
    At one time the business of the
hongs-- the name comes from "yang
hong,, meaning "foreign company"
-- was tea and opium. Today it is
telecommunications and fleets of jet-
liners. One of the hongs manages the
Coca-Cola franchises on the main-
land. Another is planning a huge
new container port on China's Yang-
tze River. Another operates a chain
of luxury hotels.
    Together the four largest hongs --
Jardine Matheson, the Swire Group,
Hutchison Whampoa and Wheelock-
Marden -- have assets of more than
$17.5 billion. All are busy buying and
selling real estate on both sides of
the Bamboo Curtain.
     Historically, boardrooms and execu-
 tive offices of the biggest hongs were
 the exclusive domain of the British
 taipans, who commanded enormous

power and staggering wealth.
    The world of the taipan was one of
turbaned Sikh doormen, chauffeur-
driven Bentleys, and luxurious, ma-
hogany-paneled cabins on company-
owned cargo ships plying the South
China Sea. As an unquestioned right
befitting his position, the taipan en-
joyed the best boxes at the Happy
Valley racecourse and the best tables
at the formerly whites-only Hong
Kong Club, described by a govern-
ment officer in the mid-19th century
as "the paradise of the select and
temple of colonial gentility."
    What made the bongs, the very
symbol of Victorian colonial expan-
sionism, acceptable to the commu-
nist landlords of this jewel in the
South China Sea is one of the most
compelling business stories of this
decade.
    "If you have someone who is your
boss today and someone who is going
to be your boss tomorrow and they
tell you to do two different things,
which one do you obey?" Clive Wee-
don, head of research at the Nomura
Research Institute of Hong Kong,
asked rhetorically in a recent inter-
view.
    This is the question that looms
over all of Hong Kong, from the
political corridors of the Legislative
Council to the locker rooms of the
Hong Kong Police Department, as the
1997 deadline approaches. The name
of the game is positioning, with com-
panies and institutions scrambling
for strategic redoubts to prepare for
the changeover.
    About the same time that the Mur-
ray-Fok switch was taking place at
Hutchison, for example, Swire Group
announced the promotion of two
Hong Kong Chinese executives to top
