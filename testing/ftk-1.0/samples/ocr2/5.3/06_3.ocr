AUTOMOTIVE

No, this is not a trick photo. Mkrocars start small and in their sporty derivatives, get even smaller.
The tiny size is prompted by Japanese regulations aimed at saving space.

      MICROCARS

  URBAN ASSAULT VEHICLE

Before you even ask, the answer is
no. No, you Cannot buy the new
660-cc, DOHC, throe-cylinder, in-
tercooled, turbocharged Mazda AZ-1
in the United States, even if you could
afford its $14,000 sticker price. The
plastic-bodied, bumperless micro-rock-
et would never meet U.S. crash safety
requirements, and tweaking its 64-
horsepower engine to pass our emis-
sions standards would erode the AZ-i's
40-mpg rating. But that didn't stop us
from throwing the mid-engine coupe
into Manhattan traffic to judge the
Japanese definition of an urban
assault vehicle.
    City vehicles need to accelerate
quickly, stop quickly, and feature good
mirrors. The AZ-1 scored well in all
three departments. Acceleration off
stop lights was brilliant, especially
when the turbo kicked in with a
scream at around 3,000 rpm. Four-
wheel disc brakes quickly checked the
1,587-pound car's excess speed and
the mirrors gave an ample view of the
New York traffic around us. Steering
was nimble and sure. Japan-market
city cars are, in some ways, an urban
commuter's dream.
    The AZ-1 failed on two key points,
however. Potholes ingested its little
13-inch wheels and strained the four-
wheel independent suspension; also,
the car's cute appearance and gull-
wing doors drew crowds anywhere it
was parked. That suggests it would
also attract thieves.

    At just less than 11 feet long, the
car had no parking problems in New
York. And it magically swallowed a
six-foot-tall test driver and a six-foot-
three-inch photographer. Getting in
and out of the car, however, required
the agility of a gymnast.
    A worthy road warrior? You bet. But
one you won't soon see in midtown
rush hour traffic.--Sandy Fritz

       EMISSIONS

       Cai' LACKS NOx

 Wider use of fuel-efficient lean-
 burn engines has been
 stymied by a major problem:
 oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. As
 fuel mixtures get leaner, exhaust gas-
 es become oxygen-rich. Excess oxygen
 makes it difficult for current catalysts
 to deoxidize NOx. For carmakers with
 lean-burn engines, an effective NOx
 catalyst has been the Holy Grail.
     Mazda claims to have found it--at
 least a version adequate for the
 Japanese market. The company re-
 cently announced a throe-way catalyst
 that removes hydrocarbons, carbon
 monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from
 lean-burn engine exhaust.
     The catalyst is based on the mineral
 zeolite, which is coated with a precious
, metal Mazda won't identify. The com-
 pany says it has confirmed the durabil-
 ity of the new catalyst in bench tests.
     For drivers, the benefit is fuel effi-
 ciency. The Mazda catalyst allows
 lean-bum operation over a wider range
 of driving conditions than current lean-
 burn engines, boosting fuel economy
 from 5 percent to 8 percent.
     The new catalyst does not yet meet
 California's strict NOx limits, however.
