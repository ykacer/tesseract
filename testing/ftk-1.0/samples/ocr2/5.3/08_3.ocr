making process, either in small teams or
individually," says Jeanette Headrick, a 5z-
year-old who joined Collins &Alkman six
years ago, just when the troubles had come
to a head. Headrick, now coordinator of the
carpet-installation department, gives credit
for the company's success to the empow-
erment-training program facilitated by
Pecos River Learning Centers of Santa Fe,
N.M., and Executive Quality Management
of Spartanburg, S.C. During the two-day
program, Headrick and her colleagues par-
ticipated in a series of exercises, such as
scaling a 42-foot wall in groups of three
linked together with rope, much as their
fates within the company would be linked.
Teammates on the ground held belay ropes
and told their climbers where to place their
feet and hands. For Headrick, a perfec-
tionist, the wall was aWaterloo: "I had to
make a decision, after talking to my team-
mates, that I was not able to climb the wall.
They had to come down with me, so it kept
them from climbing it, too." In the end, she
says, she and her teammates learned how
to work much more harmoniously. "Every-
one has their own wall, and you learn to be
more tolerant," she explains.
    As a result of programs like this one,
floor-coverings-division employees have,
over the last two years, suggested over
x,8oo ways to change procedures, pro-
cesses and products. Roughly 75 percent
of their ideas have been adopted. One
team of employees reduced the waste
from cutting carpet into tiles by 90 per-
cent. All facets of quality have improved.
The division has won four awards for
excellence in design from the Institute of
Business Designers.
    Morale has also improved. Employee
turnover fell from 27 percent in I989 to z4
percent last year. And absenteeism
declined from 3.4 to 2 percent, the indus-
try average, in spite of the fact that
employees are encouraged to take time off
when they need it, rather than penalized
for missing work.
    Unlike Collins & Aikman Textile
Group, spurred by crisis, the Taylor group
of companies moved to participative man-
agement out of foresight. James Taylor,
president and CEO, and his brother John,
treasurer, are third-generation managers
of the boat-accessories subsidiary, Nelson
A. Taylor, based in Gloversville, N.Y., that
their grandfather started in I9o8. The par-
ent company employs over 5oo people in
six plants scattered about the U.S., Ireland

and Canada. During the mid-'8os, the sub-
sidiary, an industry leader best known for
windshields and window glass, was riding
the wave of strong growth that was sweep-
ing the marine industry. That was making
the Taylors nervous. '%Ve had managed the
company as a benevolent dictatorship,"
says James. "But I started to realize that the
old way of doing things just wasn't going
to work in the future." His search for new
ideas came to an end when he discovered
Stayer's Harvard Business Review article.
    The Taylors have been working on
changing their company for almost three
years now, and they both feel strongly
that they have done the right thing. But
every step has been painful, and the
brothers agree: "You can't let your ego

get in the way," says 49-year-old James,
whose tone lets you know he has tripped
over his own ego more times than he
cares to count."You have to change your-
self," says John, 42. "The organization is
only a reflection of the people. So if all
the people believe in top-down manage-
ment, the organization is top-down." Like
Eitel, the Taylors learned early on that
empowerment cannot coexist with fear.
James realized he would have to learn to
shut up when he heard, during an early
self-management meeting, that some of his
people had coined the word"Jimidation."
    Initially, it was as hard for the workers
to take responsibility as it was for the Tay-
lors to relinquish it. "The first team we ever
formed was one to come up with new work
rules," says James. After a few weeks, sev-
eral workers told him to write the rules him-
self. All that's changing now. Workers at
each plant have written new rules for work
and compensation, and some teams even do
the hiring. The human-resources depart-
ment supports them by administering ben-
efits and assisting in locating candidates to
hire. And the managers have become coach-
es. Says John, "One job is to outline certain
legal and ethical parameters things have to
be within, and to measure everything we
do against the needs of our customers."
    Without empowerment, says James,
Nelson A. Taylor would very likely have
sunk last year, when the industry's rev-
enues fell by nearly half from '89. But the
company rode out the storm.

CAR WARS The most widely noted
American empowerment success is also at
one of the biggest companies that adhere
to this ideology--General Motors. Not
long ago, few experts would have predict-
ed that an all-new American car could
have matched the reliability of Toyotas
and H0ndas. But for the second year in a
row, GM's Saturn has done just that,
according to the current annual auto issue
of Consumer Reports.
    Some credit must go to the Saturn
plant's managers, who from the start
were determined to build the best Amer-
ican car ever. But credit must go also to
workers--and empowerment. Mercedes
Benz's 30o and I9o series, veritable
tapestries of fine engineering, are signif-
icantly less reliable than Saturn, says
Consumer Reports. But then, Daimler-
Benz, the manufacturer, is not perceived
to be as empowered or as lean as Saturn.
