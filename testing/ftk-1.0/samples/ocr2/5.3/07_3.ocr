ond-largest network of free-
standing dialysis centers, lag-
ging only W.R. Grace's. It now
treats more than 150,000 pa-
tients at more than 130 centers
nationwide, grabbing an ever
larger slice of market share in a
highly fragmented industry.
More recently, it entered the
outpatient surgery market by
acquiring two surgical centers,
which account for less than 5%
of revenues, but which, Aster
predicts, also will grow rapidly.
    Various     contemporary
trends favor Vivra's continued
growth, including industry con-
solidation, the overall aging of
the population and continued
advances in medical technology

that further expand the scope of
outpatient services. But the cur-
rent debate on national health
care also raises a red flag, Aster
admits, especially since more
than two-thirds of Vivra's dia-
lysis revenues are paid by Medi-
care -- and Medicare's reim-
bursements already are lower
than they were 10 years ago.
There's talk in Washington of
increasing dialysis payments by
2.5% a year, he adds, but
whether the increase will actu-
ally go through remains any-
one's guess.
    On the other hand, Aster
avers, reduced payments would
drive out more marginal opera-
tors, giving Vivra even more

market share, "so they win either
way, in my opinion." Boasting
"a very strong balance sheet," an
18% return on equity and a stock
price only 14.5 times 1994 earn-
ings, Vivra is, to Aster's way of
thinking, an inexpensive stock
with a strong growth potential.
Those earnings, he adds, should
come in around $1.80 a share
this year and $2.20 in 1994.

  Portfolio Analysis Of
Selected Fixed-Income Funds

(Market) Timing Is Everything

By RANDALL W. FORSYTH

MARKET timing has a bad
name, especially in mu-
tual-fund land. The funds don't
like it and most investors lose
more than they make.
    Paul Merriman dissents. He
insists that market timing does
work, particularly with bond
funds. Combining risky types of
bond funds, moreover, actually
reduces risks, he also contends.
To buy and hold a government
bond fund is what's really risky,
he adds.
    At the beginning of this year,
the Merriman Flexible Bond
Fund adopted market timing,
a strategy Merriman also uses to
manage individuals' money.
The fund invests in other bond
funds, which he says affords the
advantages of greater liquidity
and management expertise in
various sectors. He admits
there's an extra cost -- his man-
agement fee overlaid on those of
the funds, resulting in an ex-
pense ratio of 1.51%. But even
though the fund is small--about

the other zags. Global bonds and
domestic junk are good comple-
ments precisely because they're
usually out of sync. When the
U.S. economy is weak, foreign
bonds produce strong returns
because the dollar and rates are
falling while economically sensi-
tive junk lags. Conversely, junk
is strong during expansions
while foreign bonds lag because
of a rising greenback and climb-
ing interest rates.
    Merriman demonstrates by
combining two highly regarded
funds in each category, the T.
Rowe Price International Bond
Fund with the Federated High
Yield Bond Fund, for the last
four and a half years. That
period includes a recession, the
junk-bond market meltdown
and wide swings in the dollar.
For the span, the Price Interna-
tional Fund returned an average
of 9.5% annually while the Fed-
erated junk fund returned 11.9%
annually, Merriman calculates
(after deducting his manage-

being out of the junk market
during the 1989-90 collapse.
    Barron's readers can emulate
Merriman's methods using no-
load bond funds and a simpli-
fied version of his market-timing
system, which he says is purely
trend-following. Unlike the
more volatile stock market,
bonds have well-defined trends,
which makes catching the turn-
ing points easier.
    The do-it-yourself formula is
easy but requires daily updating
and discipline, Merriman points
out. Quite simply, if the fund's
net-asset value falls 3%, either
from your original purchase
price or its most recent high,
switch into a money-market
fund. Continue to track it on the
way down. When it hits a low
and rises 3% from that low,
switch back into the bond fund.
While you'll miss absolute mar-
ket tops and bottoms, you'll tend
to miss big declines and stay
invested most other times.
    As for which funds he uses,
Merriman says he sticks to no-
load funds with management
continuity and strong one-,
