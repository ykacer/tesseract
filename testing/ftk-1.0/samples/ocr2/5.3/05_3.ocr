The problem with PC
Being politically correct--PC--at
college is more than simply having
"correct" political views. It con-
notes a certain attitude--a
consciousness. PC was originally
supposed to ensure that students
in diverse college communities were sensi-
tive to ethnic differences and used nondis-
criminatory and inoffensive language. All
good intentions. But being PC isn't just
about the language you use. It's the clothes
you buy, the music you listen to, and every-
thing you read. It's the difference between
Andrew Dice Clay and Jerry Seinfeld.
 My college, Brown University, in Provi-

dence, Rhode Island, is an ac-

tivist place where subtle
pressure to be politically cor-

rect pervades student

life. I'm happy to be
at a school where
students take over.

University Hall to demand need-
blind admissions or sleep in shanty

towns on The Green in solidarity
with the homeless, and I deft-

nitely prefer action to apathy.
But sometimes I feel like it's

impossible to be apolitical at my school--it's
as if there's one way to think and feel about
a million different issues, and when I don't
agree with the accepted point of view, or I
don't have any opinion on an issue, I'm some
reactionary pig.
    In my freshman year at Brown, I pretty
much followed along with the PC herd. I re-
cycled, I bought a Brown mug to use instead
of Styrofoam cups, I even came to love those
Guatemalan sweaters that you can so conve-
niently purchase at the Brown Post Office.

Even though I went to a

fairly liberal all-girls
high school in New > j
