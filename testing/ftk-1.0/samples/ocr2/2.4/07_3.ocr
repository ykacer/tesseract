mations of thru rock have been recogmzed ~nd mapped
by Messrs. Emmons and Garrey. qhese for~nations are
not necessarily individual flows. Some of them are really
parts of a single thick flow, and others are certainly com-
posed of several flows. Intercalated between the rhyo-
lites are five flows of plagioclase basalt, one flow of
quartz latite, some stratified tuffs, and finally capping the
series, a flow of quartz-bearing basalt. The effusive
rocks are cut by intrusions of rhyolitic porphyry, plagio-
clase basalt, and leucite basanite. Most of the basalt
dikes occupy fault fissures.
The Tertiary lavas and tuffs are generally conformable
to one another, but at a few phtces slight erosional un-
conformity has been detected.
The entire series of volcanic rocks is divided by faults
into a large number of blocks in each of which the flows
are in general tilted to the east at angles up to 40°. The
fault planes strike from northwest to northeast and dip
generally to the west. The displacement as a general
rule, is normal; that is, the hanging wall in each case
has slipped down relative to the foot wall. In conse-
quence of this structure anyone traveling across the dis-
trict from west to east will see the edges ~f the same
flows repeated again and again in the successive western
fronts of the ridges.
In regard to the veins they say:
Most of the lodes are not simple veins, but are fissure
zones (of nearly vertical dip) containing numerous vein-
lets or stringers of vein material and in most cases show-
ing no definite walls. The principal stringers are parallel
with the sides of the lode as a whole, but they are linked
by numerous irregular cross veinlets, and similar small
stringers extend for varying distances into the country
rock. The lodes range in width from a few inches to 10
or even 100 feet.
Typical vein quartz, such :ts is characteristic of the
gold veins of the Appalachians or Sierra Nevada or such
as is t~ound in the pre-Tertiary schists of the Bullfrog
district, does not occur in the mines near Rhyolite, with
the exception of the Original Bullfrog. The quarts is
., Drevailingly fine grained, often of a porcelain-like tex-
ture, and is usually intercrystallized with :calcite.
