Determination of the Bquation for Silica
Mass Transfer in Rainier bsa

         Experiment 3 established that the rate of mass trans-
fer of the constituents from Rainier Mesa glass is dependent
on the reactive surface area to water volume ratio, e, in
addition to temperature. The average total surface area of

the glass samples use6 to determine the kinetic rate was
                 !

93.6 square meters. If this value, along with the rate

constant obtained for the temperature of the rock and the
value of b given in Table 4 are used in equation 8, the

equation of mass transfer of silica into the groundwater of
Rainier Mesa is obtained: ......

The Time, Surface Area, Silica Concentration
Relationahip for Rainier Plesa Groundwaters

           If Rainier Mesa precipitation is assumed void of all
silica (Freeze and Cherry, 1979) Qo equals 0.0, and equa-
tion 16 becomes:
