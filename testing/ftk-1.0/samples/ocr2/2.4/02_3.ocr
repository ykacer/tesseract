Army to Marines: 'No tanks'

it can't have
extra M 1 A1 s

The shrinking U.S. Army has ex-
cess tanks. The Marine Corps
doesn't have enough tanks. It
wants the Army's. The Army says
it can't have them.
    Gentlemen, lock 'n load. Fire
when ready.
    The Army-Marine Corps squab-
ble over M1A1 heavy battle tanks
is only the latest in a series of in-
terserviee outbreaks prompted by
declining military budgets and
rapidly shifting U.S. military pol-
icy.
    The Air Force wants to mothball
the Navy's aircraft carriers. The
Zoomies say their airplanes can
take out far-flung targets better
than any plodding boat.
    Over at the Navy Department, of
course, the Squids are lobbying to
ground the Air Force. And they
want to take missile defenses away
from the Army.
    Marines don't think all that
much of the Army, and it is well
known that the Army would like
the Marines to march off into the
sunset -- preferably, starting from
the Marines' bases at the edge of
the Pacific Ocean.
    Nobody wants the unglamorous
mission of aerial support for the
grunt infantry except the Marines,
who don't trust the Air Foree to do
it right. But the Marines don't have

Well, that's a story of politics and
pride.
    The Army plans to give the
tanks to its National Guard units,
whieh in the past have been notori-
ously poorly trained and under-
equipped with cast-off gear nobody
else wanted.
    During the Persian Gulf war,
three Guard combat brigades were
activated for service, but to the
Army's intense embarrassment,
they were judged unready for war
and had to stay home.

    Well, the Corps has always prac-
ticed reverse snobbery: It proudly
spends less money and has gener-
ally shabbier gear than everyone
else (the Corps doesn't give its Ma-
rines uniforms; it only lends them).
Despite this handicap, or perhaps
because of it, Marines say they can
outfight anybody.
    But they don't have the cash for
new tanks, which would cost close
to a billion dollars (the other serv-
ices lose at least that much in a
typical year).

 the Marines should get the (anks
 they need.

  That should be the end of ii.
  It's not.

     Frank Kendall, director of tacti-
 cal warfare programs at the Penta-
 gon, agrees that the Army should
 give its excess tanks to the Ma-
 rines. But the Army insists there
' are no excess tanks; those it has
 have been promised to the Guard.

  Further, Kendall says that while

The Army has about 1,500 M1A1 tanks sitting idle in Europe. The Marines would like to get their hands
on them, but the Army says it plans to give them to National Guard units instead.
