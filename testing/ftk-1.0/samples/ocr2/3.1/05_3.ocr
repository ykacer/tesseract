Colorful Corn Salad Has
Winning Flavor and Looks
            By Mary Beth Jung, CW Food Editor

SAMPLING the great-tasting corn rec-
ipes entered in our recent contest had
Country Woman ~ panel of judges grin-
ning from ear to ear. (Sorry...I couldn't
resist just one "corny" line!)
    Honestly, our taste-testers had plen-
ty to smile about as they savored the
golden corn casseroles, chowders, muf-
fins, fritters, relishes, salads and side
dishes shared by subscribers.
    When the last kernels were cleaned
from the plates and the votes tallied,
Fresh Corn Salad from Carol Shaffer
of Cape Girardeau, Missouri took top
honors, earning high marks for its tangy,

fresh flavor and its eye-appealing colors.
    Carol was delighted when I phoned
her with the good news. "I make this
corn salad often for family get-togeth-
ers,'' she told me. "It's always a hit at in-
formal outdoor barbecues, too. I love
recipes that call for homegrown ingre-
dients-next to cooking, gardening is
one of my favorite hobbies."
    She's had lots of experience at both,
I learned. Raised in a rural area, Carol
was helping her mother prepare family
suppers and put up produce by age 10.
    "Mom and I still cook together often
and always team up to prepare family
meals on holidays and birthdays," Car-
ol informed. "We also get together to
swap and test out recipes we've clipped
from magazines and newspapers.
    "Between us, we have 30 cookbooks
and files full of recipes--too many to
count!"
    Counting on tasting them all is Car-
ol's husband-to-be, Danny. "We're get-
ting married this summer, in time to
tend to and harvest our first mutual
garden," Carol related. "We'll grow
cucumbers, peas, carrots, okra, toma-
toes and, of course, corn."
  Gardening, cooking and a full-time

job as a seamstress keep her busy, but
Carol assured there's always time for
Fresh Corn Salad. "It tastes best when
you make it ahead and let it sit in the
refrigerator overnight," she said. "Then
just put it in your picnic cooler and go!"
    Credit goes to her mother, Carol
added, for her entering CWk corn rec-
ipe contest. "I'd nearly forgotten about
it when Mom reminded me of the ap-
proaching deadline. I sat right down
and wrote out my entry, never dream-
ing I'd win!"
    Win she did, and soon she and three
guests will be enjoying her Grand Prize
free dinner at a favorite restaurant.
    I can't wait to hear all about it after-
ward. You might say I'm all ears! [~

All Eyes'Il Be on This Ear of Corn

EVERYBODY likes to spread a pat or
two of butter on a steaming ear of corn
on the cob. But butter inside the ear?
    That's the fun behind this bright new
butter dish I recently came across--it's
shaped and colored just like a nice fresh
ear of sweet corn straight off the stalk!
    It added lots of laughter to our CW
kitchen during testing for the corn rec-
ipe contest. And it will do the same for
your summer get-togethers...and, for
that matter, meals all year long.
    There's no fooling when it comes to
the quality of this dish, however. Made
of glazed pottery, it retains its vibrant
green and yellow colors through many

washings. Sizewise, it holds a standard
l/4-1b, stick of butter under its cheery
ear top.
    Your nearest department store may
carry this Corn Butter Dish. In case it
doesn't, however--or if you'd simply
prefer to order by mail--I've asked our
Country Store to make it available also.
Here's what you need to do to get one:
    Write to Country Store, Suite 3180C,
P.O. Box 990, Greendale WI 53129.
Or call toll-free 1-800/558-1013. The
cost is $14.98 each (plus $2.50 ship-
ping/handling for the first dish and 50¢
s/h for each additional one). Ask for
item 12302.      --Mary Beth Jung
