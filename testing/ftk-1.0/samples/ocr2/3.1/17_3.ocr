          PUMICEOUS
     PYROCLASTIC-FLOW
           DEPOSITS

    Pyroclastic flows are high-velocity surface flows of
high-temperature fragmental material. Such flows
potenti~-lly are very destructive because of their high
temperatures and great mobility. Historic flows have
been observed to travel a few kilometers from vents
at velocities of up to 60 m/s, and analyses of
prehistoric deposits suggest that large flows can cover
distances of as much as 100 km at velocities of up to
200 m/s.
    Pyroclastic flows are commonly subdivided on the
basis of constituent materials and grain size into ash
flows, pumice flows, lithic pyroclastic flows, block-
and-ash flows, and so on. Ash flows consist chiefly of
ash-sized particles of glass shards and phenocrysts;
the term pumice flow is applied if pumice lapilli and
blocks are dominant. Ash flows are a common type
of pyroclastic flow, especially in large-volume erup-
tions. Block-and-ash flows contain abundant, large,
~ttle-vesiculated fragments and commonly form by
explosive disruption or gravitational failure of the
flank of a growing lava dome. Many pyroclastic
flows are preceded by a ground-hugging hurricane-
like surge cloud and accompanied by an overriding
ash cloud, each of which may result in recognizable
deposits.
    Pumiceous pyroclastic flows of mafic dacite occur-
red during six major 1980 eruptions at Mount St.
Helens (May 18, May 25, June 12, July 22, August 7,
and October 16-18). This sequence presented excep-
tional opportunities to observe and photograph
pyrodastic flows in motion, study their primary
depositional features, measure thermal and rheolog-
ical properties, relate size and sorting parameters to
eruption characteristics, and monitor compositional
changes. In general, time intervals between successive
pyroclastic eruptions increased during 1980, and

eruptive volumes, vesicularity,         and degree of
chemical differentiation decreased.
    Pyroclastic flows were first observed shortly after
noon on May 18; resulting deposits extend as much as
8 km from the vent, cover an area of about 15 km:,
and have a bulk volume of about 0.2 km3 (Rowley
and others). The deposits form a fan-like pattern of
sheets, tongues, and lobes of mostly poorly sorted
ash and clasts of pumice and dense dacite. Succes-
sively younger 1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits, in gen-
eral, cover progressively smaller areas and have
smaller volumes. The flows formed along with devel-
opment of large vertical ash columns. Most pyro-
clastic flows originated when bulbous masses of ash,
lapilli, and blocks rose only a short distance above
the inner crater before spreading laterally to the
north, but some flows were observed to result from
gravitational collapse of parts of an accompanying
vertical ash column.
    Morphologic and rheologic measurements on pyro-
dastic-flow deposits of July 22 and August 7 indicate
that the flows moved as non-Newtonian fluids, most
readily modelled as Bingham plastics (Wilson and
Head). Reverse grading of coarse, low-density
pumice clasts in marginal levee deposits is interpreted
as the consequence of briefly increased fluidization,
related to interaction between the flow and surround-
ing air at the time of emplacement.
    Petrographic and textural studies indicate that all
1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits consist mainly of
juvenile dacite, containing plagioclase, hypersthene,
hornblende, and Fe-Ti-oxide phenocrysts in a vesic-
ular glassy matrix (Kuntz and others). In general, suc-
cessively younger deposits show increasing modal
proportions of plagioclase, hypersthene, and Fe-Ti-
oxide phenocrysts, increasing average anorthite con-
tent of plagioclase, increasing phenocryst:glass ratios,
and decreasing porosity. These relations suggest that
successive eruptions have tapped deeper levels in a
compositionally zoned magma chamber, have pro-
gressively depleted the magma of volatiles, and have
been characterized by decreased amounts of vesicula-
tion and gas thrust.
