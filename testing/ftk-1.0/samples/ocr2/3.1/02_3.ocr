Nixon legacy: Achievement,

Watergate eclipsed his gains as statesman

Washington Post

Richard Nixon, the 37th president of
the United States -- a polarizing fig-
ure who won a record landslide and
resigned in disgrace 21 months later
-- died Friday night in a New York
City hospital four days after suffering
a stroke. He was 81.

Officials of the New York Hospital-
Cornell Medical Center, where he
had slipped into a deep coma on
Thursday, said Nixon died at 8:08
p.m. Twin Cities time.

Nixon's family was with him when
he died, the officials said. His two
daughters -- Tricia Cox and Julie
Eisenhower -- have been at the hos-
pital; his wife, Pat, died last year.

President Clinton made a brief for-
mal announcement in the White
House Rose Garden. He described
Nixon as "a statesman who sought to
build a lasting structure of peace."

A statement from the Richard Nixon
Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda,
Calif., said the funeral would be at
the library at 4 p.m. Wednesday, Cal-
ifornia time. Clinton said he would
attend the service, and declared a
national day of mourning.

Nixon had a stroke at his home in
Park Ridge, N.J., shortly before din-
ner Monday evening and was taken
by ambulance to the hospital in Man-

hattan.

He was alert for the first day but
unable to speak or to move his right
arm or leg, and on Tuesday he was
moved out of the hospital's intensive
care unit to a private room. But on
Tuesday night, he developed symp-
toms of cerebral edema, or swelling
of the brain, which caused his condi-
tion to worsen. He declined from
being semiconscious on Wednesday
