'D~din~ on Site topography, warm' bodies, and
meteorological conditions, the s.i~ representative
extreme windspeeds may be simply interpoletad
values between distributions derived from ex-
isting wind staUon data. For sites located in
complex ttu-reln, physical modeling may be used
to relate wind data available at an existing wind
station to expected wind characteristics at a
proposed site (Cernutk [12]).

42 Vfmda at a Standard Level The anemometer
height above ground varies from wind station to
wind station and may v~ry from t,~e to time at
the same station. Thus, it is necessary to extra-
polate or interpolate the wind data to a standard
height. The standard height shall be 33 ft (10 m).
The extrapolation shall be done by the power law:.

where

 V~3 is the windspeed at 33 feet
 Vz is the measured windspeed at height z
     above the ground in feet
     depends on terrain roughness at the sta-
     tion site. Terrain categories defined in
     ANSI A58.1-1982 [11] shall be acceptable;
     may also be determined by eite-spK~fied
     data analyses.

4.3 Deriving the Extreme Windepeed. Tim
Fisher-Tippett Type I extreme value distribu-
tion shall be used to obtain the design basis
windspeads. Typi~ applicaCiom of t, hla apptmch
have been demonstrated in Simiu Changer,/and
FRliben [13]. It may be n~__eyary in rq~ions
under the influence of different types of utreme
wind regimes to utilize other statistical dist. ribu-
tions as long as they can be demonstrated to be
more applicable to the site b~in~ considered
{Mayne [14]).
