Figure 18.19 Eldorado Range in the North Cascades National Park; head of Boston Glacier.

Tatoosh Pluton at Mount Rainier~ the Snoqualmie
Pluton to the north, and the Cloudy Pass batho-
lith at Glacier Peak. are middle Tertiary. The
older, which include the Colville~ Osoyoos,
Similkameen and Chelan plutons (Fig. 18.20) or
batholiths, are late Mesozoic.

    LOWER CALIFORNIA (PENINSULAR
                   RANGE) PROVINCE

    The Lower California Province, situated be-
t~veen the Salton Trough and the coast~ is the
northern end of Baja California. The province is
a batholith of granite that, in part at least, is of
Cretaceous age, intrusive into Lower Cretaceous
formations and overlain by younger, Upper Cre-
taceous ones. The granite forms a westward-
tilted plateau, the east front of which is a tre-
mendous east-facing escarpment, like the east
front of the Sierra Nevada. San Jacinto Peak at
the north end is more than 11.000 feet in altitude
and overlooks Salton Trough, which extends
below sea level. Northwest-trending faults ex-
tend obliquely across the escarpment and divide
it into a series of northwest-trending mountains.
    Along the coast are wave-cut marine terraces
of Pleistocene age (Fig. 18.21). These terraces,
some of which are as much as 1,300 feet above
sea level, record a series of Pleistocene uplifts.
The terraces are warped, for the uplift was irreg-
ular.

    Similar terraces on the coasts of some of the
offshore islands are further evidence of different
amounts of uplift on different structural blocks.
San Clemente Island is terraced practically to its
summit (1,480 feet). Santa Catalina Island has
only a few poorly developed terraces, even
though it lies between San Clemente Island and
the Palos Verdes Hills, both of which are promi-
nently terraced.

         PACIFIC BORDER PROVINCE

    GREAT VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. The Great Val-
ley of California~ situated between the Sierra
Nevada and the Coast Ranges, is a structural
trough--part of a Tertiary and Quaternary geo-
syncline. In the south~ where the structural depth
is greatest, Tertiary and younger formations bury
the granitic batholith and its roof rocks to a
depth of at least 3 miles. The axis of the trough
is near the western edge of the Great Valley,
where the base of the geosynclinal sediments has
not been reached by even the deepest drill holes.
Most of the sedimentary deposits were derived
by erosion of the Sierra Nevada; the youngest
form long, low alluvial fans that slope westward
from the foot of the Sierra. The sedimentary
formations in the trough, are richly petroliferous,
especially toward the south, and some of Cali-
fornia's principal oil fields are producing from
them.
