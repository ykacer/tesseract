                 PRE-TERTIARY STRATA

             Pre-Tertiary rocks of the southern Grapevine Mountains comprise
the uppermost part of the thick sequence of Pcecambrian(?) and Ca~rlan
strata that is widely exposed in the Death Vel ley area (Jennings, 1958).
The lower half of the mapped rocks, assigned in ascending order to
the Stirling Quartzite, Wood Canyon Formation, and Zabriskle Quartzite,
Is largely of detrital origin, composed mainly of siltstone, mudstone,
and fine sandstone with scattered beds of fine-pebble conglomerate.

Carbonate rocks form .~st of the upper half of the sequence end ace

separated fn~n the detrital rocks by a thin transition zone. The Carrere
Formation includes rocks of the transition zone, whereas the carl~na~
rocks are divided into the ~anza King and Nopah Fo~tlons. These
carbonate rocks belong to the eastern, or carbonate, facies recognized
in much of the Paleozolc succession in the eastern and southeastern
Great Basin (Nolan, 1943; Palmer, 1956, among others).

             The pre-Tertiary rocks ace described in detai I, because their
occurrence in the Grapevine Mountains is the northernmost occurrence
of the Death Val lay "facies" on the east side of Death Vel lay. I<nov-
ledge of the stratigraphic detail is essential for reconstruction of
fortes patterns, or offsets thereof, by major faults in the ecea

              In the Titus and Titanothece Canyons area, as in most of the
southern Great Basin, the Pcecambrian-Cambrian stratlgraphic sequence
is virtually continuous; no stratigraphic break coincides with the
boundary between the Pcecambrian and the Cambrian systems. In order to
