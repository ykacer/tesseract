Expressway Ramps Closed

    The roar of the jackhammers
continues on both the Kennedy
and Stevenson expressways. On
the Kennedy reconstruction, the
outbound exit ramp at North Ave-

nue will close
Monday, fol-
lowed by the
Fullerton exit
on Wednes-
day. The good
news: The Di-
versey Avenue
slip ramp has
reopened, pro-
viding easier
access to the
express lanes.

On the Stevenson, the outbound
Damen Avenue off-ramp shut
down Friday and will be closed
until the Monday morning rush.
Traffic on the Stevenson remains

reduced to two lanes in each di-
rection between the Dan Ryan
and the Tri-State Tollway. In the
Loop, crews painting the CTA L
structure will reduce lanes on
Lake Street between Wells and
Wabash. Elsewhere downtown,
viaduct work has closed Lake
Street to all traffic between
Wacker and Canal. Viaduct work
has reduced Washington to four
lanes between Canal and Clinton.
