Fig. 5. Temperature measurements in granitic rocks of the Sierra Nevada
province adjusted to a common temperature origin at the surface.
Stations are about 30 km apart on a line from the western margin (ST) to
the range crest (HC) [Lachenbruch, 1968].

    The heat flow, normally measured in the upper 1% of the crust, pro-
vides only a boundary condition from which we should like to determine
the thermal regime of the crust, i.e., to determine q(z) throughout the
entire crust. This requires a knowledge of how the terms on the right
side of (3) vary throughout the crust. To provide meaningful constraints
on these terms we must obtain insight into the physical processes that
they represent. Interpretations of the crustal regime generally repre-
sent attempts to integrate (3) with simplifications believed to be
appropriate for specific regions.
    In our discussion, A will represent heat generated by radioactive
decay of U, Th, and 40K, elements present in minute amounts in crustal
rocks. The process goes on steadily, irrespective of what else might be
happening in the earth. The second term on the right in (3) represents
effects of relative vertical movement of crustal (and upper mantle)
masses; they may be solid blocks moving along faults or magmatic and
aqueous fluids generally moving through fractures created by faulting or
through pore spaces. As these movements are generally intermittent or
short-lived, they generate transient disturbances represented by the
last term in (3). Surface indicators of these mass movements are earth-
quakes, young volcanic rocks, and hot springs, which are shown with the
heat flow distribution in Figures 3, 7, and 8. These manifestations are
generally concentrated in the western regions of anomalously high heat
flow, suggesting that the anomalies there are due primarily to convec-
tion and associated transients (i.e., to effects of the last two terms
in (3)). The manifestations are rare in regions of low heat flow in the
Sierra Nevada and the eastern half of the United States, and the crustal
