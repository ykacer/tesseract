the band asked if we would license them
the name so they could tour. Judy and I
said, "Go for it"; we get a small percent-
age of the take. I go out and play the
harp sometimes. We do Soul Man and
Knock on Wood. We rip the house apart.
PLAYBOY: How do you rate your musical
abilities?
AYKROYDI I'm a great emcee-front man
and I can move onstage. It's funny and
exciting to see a man of two hundred-
plus pounds moving in such a way that it
looks like he knows reasonably well
where he's going and he's not going to
hurt people.
PLAYBOY' What are your musical tastes
these days?
AYKROYD: I listen a lot. My favorites are
the Black Crowes, Robert Cray, Bonnie
Raitt, Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughan,
Kim Wilson and the Thunderbirds.
There's also a new band called Blues
Traveler with an amazing new young
harmonica player named John Popper.
PLAYBOY: Might there be another Blues
Brothers movie?
AYKROYDl I'm working on a story with
John Landis, who directed the original.
We're going to try to bring back every-
body from the first movie. We have to
convince the studio. The walls of Univer-
sal are still stained from the first Blues
Brothers movie.
PLAYBOY: Stained? Didn't Universal
make money on that?
AYKROYD: Not really, because it cost so
much. They made their money back, but
it was traumatic getting the movie made.
It was an enormous production. John
was out of control.
PLAYBOY' You've often been criticized for
creating movies with runaway budgets.
AYKROYD: We are always criticized for
costs--for 1941, Ghostbusters, Blues Broth-
ers-but that money doesn't go into the
pockets of the actors and directors, it
goes into the pockets of labor.
PLAYBOY: And special effects and
wrecked cars ....
AYKROYD: The major expense of Blues
Brothers was not the seventy police cars
we bought from the Chicago Police De-
partment. We paid only $700 each for
them. The major expense was labor, so
that's good, it gets people working, and
why shouldn't the profits of the mega-
corporations be reinvested in the trades
of this industry? IfI write a big show and
it costs a lot of money, I make no apolo-
gies. I'd be a wealthier man today and a
better businessman if I sat down and
wrote small movies that cost little and
brought in lots.
PLAYBOY; Will you continue to make se-
quels-whether based on the Blues
Brothers, Ghostbusters, Coneheads or
others?
AYKROYO: As long as there is something
new to do with them and it's enjoyable.
It's kind of nice to have built-in franchis-
es. The one I don't think we'll necessari-
ly further exploit is Ghostbusters. It looks

like that's about had its run.
PLAYBOY: Because Ghostbusters H did
poorly?
AYKROYDl Yeah. It opened and Batman
opened the next weekend and wiped us
out that summer. Although we made a
good movie, it just wasn't as commercial-
ly successful as everybody thought it
would be. If I could get that team to-
gether, it would be a real dream, because
I think there's a great story to be told.
But it won't be for a while. By the way, I
heard a great ghost story about an old
Manhattan hotel, the Sheraton, that is
now the Chinese consulate on 42nd
Street on the West Side. We were shoot-
ing on the fifth floor in a banquet room.
I was outside having a smoke and I saw
this guy go down the hall in an Air Force
jacket with master sergeant stripes. I
asked him what was up. He told me he
was an electronic-countermeasures tech-
nician who installs ECM packs on F-16s
and F-106s and all that. He told me that
his father worked in the building and
then he mentioned, "We can't keep
guards." When I asked what he meant,
he said they had gone through five secu-
rity guards. They would come runnietg
downstairs, yelling, "You can keep your
job." They finally questioned one, who
said, "I was making my rounds and I saw
something come through a wall."
    When the man was asked what he had
seen, he said, "It was a man's head and
shoulders. He was wearing red." So this
guy and his dad and brother go up there
to check it out. They were walking on
the fifth floor and they saw something go
across the hall: a guy wearing a red
chef's hat and holding a knife and fork.
They followed him into the kitchen and
he disappeared into the mashed-potato
mixer.
    He said they researched the employee
records of the hotel and found that a
week after it had closed, the roast beef
chef, who had been there for fifteen
years or something, went to a bar
around the corner and drank himself to
death. His presence is still around.
PLAYBOY: Do you believe that story?
AYKROYDI It's a perfect example of a
ghost story I can place credence in be-
cause it was unsolicited. Now that the
Chinese consulate is there, I've wanted
to talk to someone in charge and ask if
there have been any experiences with
the presence.
PLAYBOY' Have you ever had a personal
experience with a presence?
AYKROVD: My wife and I bought Mama
Cass' old house in Hollywood. It is
where Cream, John Lennon and Harry
Nillson used to hang out. Ringo owned it
for a while. California Dreamin' was re-
hearsed there. We have a presence in
that house. A psychic came in and told us
that some guy apparently died of a drug
overdose in the living room. My wife and
I told a friend of ours about it and he
turned ashen and gasped. He said, "I

know about that." It happened just as
the psychic said. It was something that
had been hushed up.
PLAYBOY: You called a psychic?
AYKROYO: We had to. The maid wouldn't
go upstairs. Also, my mother experi-
enced some stuff there and some friends
heard the piano playing and then heard
footsteps and doors closing. When the
psychic said she couldn't deal with it, my
wife went to more traditional methods--
religion--to try to get rid of it. But we
think it's still there because recently the
other maid went upstairs and a door
slammed. Another time I was alone in
the house in bed and I felt the mattress
depress behind me like something was
getting into bed. You know what my
reaction was? I didn't hop up. I wiggled
my rump right up next to it. I thought,
If you can like me this much, you're go-
ing to ,feel me right next to you.
PLAYBOY: Did you believe in ghosts as
a child?
AYKROVO: Of course. They had s{Sances at
the old family farm where I grew up. My
mother witnessed an apparition. I once
saw some lights I couldn't explain. My
father was a psychic researcher, so it was
really passed down to me.
PLAYBOY: It seems Ghostbusters is your
idea of a documentary, not fiction. Are
you pulling our leg?
AYKROYDl Definitely not. The other day
I read that Harold Ramis, my colleague
in Ghostbusters, said he doesn't believe
in ghosts!
PLAYBOY: And that surprises you?
AYKROYDI Yes, because he is a very smart
person. I'm going to bring him up to
Dudley Town, Massachusetts and scare
the shit out of him sometime. I'll take
him to the most haunted place on earth.
He's my man. He's going. I can't believe
he offhandedly says he doesn't believe
in ghosts when it's a reality of life on
this planet. He's going to get spanked
for that.
PLAYBOY: Don't you require more proof
of ghosts than those vague experiences?
AYKROYD: Sure. I'm a skeptic. If some-
body tells me a ghost story, I want proof.
I want to know if he or she was smoking
or drinking. In eighty percent of the cas-
es I've inquired about, you can put a
name to the presence, a human name.
You know why they're there.
PLAYBOY: Why are they there?
AYKROYD: They died in an unfulfilling
and unsatisfied way and they are linger-
ing here in this world for something that
they'll never have. And it's very simple.
Very simple.
PLAYBOY: Frankly, Ramis' view isn't much
of a surprise to us.
AYKROYD: But Harold's such a brilliant
philosopher. He knows that the empiri-
cal scientific world is not all there is.
Maybe that's all he sees. I just can't be-
lieve that he means it. He's such a practi-
cal man, I suppose.
