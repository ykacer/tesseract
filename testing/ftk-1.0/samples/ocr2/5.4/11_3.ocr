we would perish. We
could learn to do
without the flow of
electrons that power
VCRs and food processors, but the currents inside
our bodies are vital. The brain needs electricity to
issue its commands from neuron to neuron. When
these signals reach a muscle, they set up a wave of

electrical excitation in the fibers, which in turn trig-
gers the chemical reactions that make the fibers
contract or relax. The most important muscle is
the heart; it shudders under a wave of electricity
about once each second.
    The heart's electric field radiates out into the
chest cavity, sending clues about the heart's fimction
toward the skin. Cardiologists can get a peek at the
heart by taping electrodes to a person's torso; each
electrode produces a familiar squiggle on an elec-
trocardiogram that shows how the voltage changes
at that single point on the body. Cardiologists spend
years learning to infer heart fimction from these sig-
nals and to recognize in EKG readings the telltale
signs of dangerous heart conditions.
    But looking at an EKG is like watching a hurri-
cane from a porthole. The 6 to 12 electrodes on a
patient's torso and limbs provide only limited in-
formation about the heart, from which doctors
draw inferences based on 80 years' worth of expe-
rience with EKGs. So cardiologists also use isotope
imaging, echocardiograms, and other methods to
gather data. In rare cases, surgeons even have to
open the chest just to find the cardiac cells that are
misbehaving.
    Chris Johnson wants to figure out how to see a
heart without cracking open a rib cage. This Uni-
versity of Utah computer scientist has been working
with physiologists, surgeons, and other researchers
there to visualize the electric field created by a heart-
beat. Ultimately Johnson hopes that he will help cre-
ate an entirely new diagnostic tool--to let cardiolo-
gists, as it were, watch the hurricane from space.
    Johnson has been developing his methods for
making these calculations since 1985, when he was
a graduate student. Last year, when he was ready to
use some real heart measurements, he wanted to get
them from a heart with clear electrical abnormali-
ties. A condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome was a perfect candidate. This birth defect
gives its victims an extra patch of cardiac cells that
sometimes sets off the contraction of the ventri-
cles-the main pumping chambers--too quickly,
throwing off the heart's rhythm. While the condi-
tion is not difficult to diagnose, the offending patch
