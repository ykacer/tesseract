Addiction medicine, one of the hottest medical specialties
today, has grown up in a hurry. The American Society of
Addiction Medicine, formed in 1954 mostly to treat the
ravages of akohollsm, now has 3,500 members, all
physicians. The following facilities offer highly regarded

I programs for treating addictive behaviors. Some specialize in
alcohol and drug addiction; others treat "dual diagnosis" patients, who
 suffer from chemical dependency as a result of sexual abuse or
 other traumas. Most of the centers listed have inpatient and outpatient
 programs with aftercare services. Patients stay from one week to seven
 months, at a cost ranging from $200 to $1,000 per day. Be warned: Most
 medical-insurance policies do not fully reimburse treatment costs.
