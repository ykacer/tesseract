year and reduce water-heating costs by
up to $80. Prices range from $10 to $50.
Water-saving shower heads are prefera-
ble to flow restrictors that insert between
the shower head and the shower arm.
Restrictors may result in a weaker spray.
    At the sink. Don't leave the water
running while you brush your teeth,
shave, or wash your face. Fill the sink
rather than use a constant stream. This
simple procedure can save your family as
much as 2,000 gallons a year.
    Clothes washers. Front-load washers
use 33 percent less water than top-load
washers. For the average family of four,
this adds up to a savings of 3,000 gallons
a year. For the washer you have now, be

mindful of the water-level settings you
use. Don't wash a medium load on a higher setting--
a mistake manufacturers say people frequently make.
    Dishwashing. Washing dishes by hand takes about 16
gallons of water. The same dishes can be cleaned in a dish-
washer with 7 to 10 gallons. You reduce your savings,
however, if you prerinse or wash less than full loads.
    Faucet aerators. A faucet aerator can cut water use in
half, and save up to 100 gallons a year per faucet. Aerators
slow a conventional faucet's flow down to about 2 gallons
per minute. Aerators for kitchen and bath faucets can be

 found in most hardware stores. They cost
 between $3 and $10, and simply screw
 onto your faucet nozzle.
    Check for leaks. On your next trip
away from home, check for leaks in your
water system. Write down the numbers
on your water meter when you leave, and
check the meter again upon returning. If
it has moved at all, you have a leak.
    Your first suspect should be the toilet.
Add a few drops of a nonstaining dye to
the water in the tank. If the color shows
up in the bowl, or if it's gone after a few
hours, you have a leak. Check the flush-
ball or flapper and replace if necessary. A
sheet of paper left under a faucet over-
night will indicate a leak there. Also
check water supply lines and fittings in-

side your cabinets for signs of dampness. If you can't find
the leak, call a plumber. Undetected leaks can cause struc-
tural damage and attract termites and carpenter ants.
    Outdoor water use. Water your lawn and garden early
in the morning. Watering during the day loses water to
evaporation, and watering at night may lead to fungus or
mildew problems. For efficient and hassle-free watering,
install trickle irrigation and timed sprinklers. Ground cov-
ers and other drought-tolerant landscaping methods greatly
reduce summer water demand. [~
