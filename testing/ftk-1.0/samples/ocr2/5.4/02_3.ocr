Finding the

More than any other feature, your hair influences
the way you look. You can apply your makeup
perfectly, dress impeccably, but if your hair's not
right, everything's wrong. Here, we help four hair-
hampered women find a style that suits them.

· Her too-thick hair was
dry and damaged.

of damaged locks, blunt-
cut the bottom and added
long layers around her
/bce. Ivo~, foundation,
camel and rust eye
shadow, and apricot
blush continued the
warming trend.
