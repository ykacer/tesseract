number                                                Description

           Data available from Investigations 8.3.1.8.1 (volcanic
             activity), 8.3.1.17.3 (vibratory ground motion), 8.3.1.17.4
             (preclosure tectonic data collection analysis), and 8.3.1.4.2
             (geologic framework), and Information Need 8.3.2.2.3
             (underground facility orientation and layout).

   2            Yilestones Z379, Z380~ and Z382. A series of reports to be
                   available for use by Issue 1.11 (configuration of underground
                   facilities (postclosure)), assessing the effects on waste
                   package integrity resulting from faulting, folding, deforma-
                   tion, and igneous intrusive processes, and on expected repos-
                   itory ground motions during the postclosure period (Milestone
                   Z381).

           Data input to Issue 1.11 from reports assessing the effects of
             faulting, folding, deformation and igneous intrusive
             processes on waste package performance.
