Three major North American forests are: the Northern Forest of spruce and fir that
extends across Canada from the Maritime Provinces to Alaska; the Western
Forests of the United States and southern Canada, which include the Pacific
Forest and Rocky Mountain forests: and the Eastern Forests of the United States,
which include southern extensions of the Northern Forest in the higher
Appalachians and Great Lakes region, Central Forest of hardwoods on the flanks
of the Appalachians, and in the Central Lowlands, Southern Pine Forest of the
Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain, and representatives of Tropical Forest in
southernmost Florida and Texas. This view shows redwoods at Humboldt
