4.4 UNDERGROUND FACILITIES

        (5 to 10 pages of text~ 5 to 10 drawings)

        Supported by general underground layout drawings, the narrative will
define the design concepts for the underground facilities. It will explain
the relationship of the exploratory shaft (ES) facilities to the repository
layout and how the ES facilities will be used both during the development of
the repository and during each stage of repository operation. The description
of the layout will include the shaft stations, maintenance areas, storage
areas, muck-handling facilities, administrative and support areas, main access
ways, ventilation return drifts, cross cuts, drainage system, emplacement
rooms, waste-emplacement openings, and the required utilities.

         Included in the narrative should be (1) the design rationale for the
underground layout: (2) the design of openings, including the parameters
considered in developing the design: (3) the rock-support systems to be used:
and (q) the sequence of development for the various phases of the project. If
alternative concepts are being considered, they will be discussed to the level
of detail provided for the primary concept.

    The underground-layout drawings will include the following:

        General arrangement drawings depicting the operational arrangement
        for each phase of development.
