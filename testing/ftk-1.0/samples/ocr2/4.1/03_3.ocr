altitude. The mountains are composed largely of
late Mesozoic granitic, batholiths--by far the
greatest of the baiholiths along the Pacific Coast
of North America. 1.000 miles long and in places
more than 100 niiles wide. At many places the
western base of the mountains descends abruptly
to oceanic depths some thousands of feet below
sea level: the relic'f, therefore, is much greater
than the mountainous heights one sees. At Van-
couver and Queen Charlotte islands and the is-
lands of southeastern Alaska are comparative
lowlands formed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic
eugeosynclinal sedimentary formations. The
many islands are separated by deep trenches,
most of them fault valleys. The summits are very
jagged with numerous matterhorns and aretes
between the ice-filled cirques. Many or most of
the glaciers extend to within 500 feet of the sea
and some reach the sea. The deep, steep-walled
valleys that extend into the mountains form
spectacular fjords. During the Pleistocene, gla-
ciers from the Coast Mountains crossed the Strait
of Georgia and extended onto Vancouver Island.
    East of the Coast Mountains. are interior
mountain ranges, mostly under 8.000 feet altitude,

and mostly formed of folded Mesozoic eugeo-
synclinal formations. Associated with these
ranges are extensive plateaus capped by lavas.
The most extensive of these extends the southern
half of British Columbia covering about 15,000
square miles along each side at an altitude of
about 3,000 to 4,000 feet. It covers much of the
south half of British Columbia. The lava-capped
plateau, at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, has
three large shield volcanoes near the middle of
the west side. The lavas are Tertiary to Holocene
in age. They overlie folded and faulted eugeo-
synclinal sedimentary formations, including
Paleozoic rocks on the east and Mesozoic on the
west. The canyon of the Frazer River is incised
into the plateau and reaches the Strait of Georgia
in a valley that curves around the south end of
the Coast Mountains (Fig. 18.29).
    Uplift of the Coast Mountains began in Juras-
sic time. and during the Cretaceous Period this
was part of a mountainous area west of the geo-
synclinal sea that connected the Gulf of Mexico
and the Artic Ocean (Fig. 2.14,C; p. 378). Struc-
tural deformation and igneous activity have con-
tinued to the present time. One volcano, Mount
