Unmarried couple
sues man who
won't rent to them

     TURNERS FALLS, Mass. --
 It's a bumpy ride up a mountain
 road to the spotless home of Paul
 and Louise Desilets.
     He is a carpet cleaner and local
 landlord, devoutly Roman Cath-
 olic and contemplative. She
 directs Sunday school at Our
 Lady of Czestochowa Church. As
 a hospice visiting nurse, she com-
 forts patients who choose to die
 at home.
     But there are certain choices in
 life that the Desilets cannot
 abide.
     "Allowing fornication to occur
 on property I own places my eter-
 nal soul at risk," says Paul,
 seated in his living room near a
 two-foot statue of the Virgin
 Mary.
     Instead, Desilets, 41, has put
 himself at legal risk by refusing to
 rent an apartment to an unmar-
 ried couple.
     That would be Mark Lattanzi
 and Cynthia Tarail.

 Lawsuit's fifth year
     Lattanzi and Tarail's anti-dis-
 crimination suit is entering its
 fifth year in Massachusetts and is
 sparking a national debate about
 fair housing, religious freedom
 and sexual mores. Twenty-four
 rroups -- from Focus on the
 amily to Gay and Lesbian
 Advocates and Defenders --
 have filed friend-of-the-court
 briefs in the matter pending
 before the state supreme court.
     Lattanzi came to the Connecti-
 cut River village of Turners Falls
 in 1989 as a Vista worker orga-
 nizing tenants to buy buildings
 and convert them to cooperative
 housing.
     Now, at 27, he is a local coordi-
 nator for a private project against
 housing discrimination.

When Lattanzi and Tarail saw
an ad in the local daily newspa-
· per for a $400-a-month, two-bed-
room apartment, they were inter-
ested. They had been sharing the
rent with a family of four in a
five-room apartment.

'Living in sin'
    "Then you'd be living in sin,
and we don't go for that. Don't
you know it's a criminal act to
cohabitate and fornicate?" Tarail
says she was told, or words to
that effect.
    Desilets says he never said any-
thing about living in sin, but did
say he did not want to rent to "an
unmarried cohabitating couple."
    Fornication, defined as sexual
relations between unmarried
eople, is punishable by a $30
ne and as long as three months
in jail in Massachusetts, although
no one remembers the last time it
was prosecuted.
    Cohabitation was decriminal-
ized in 1987. Since 1974, it has
been against the law in Massa-
chusetts to deny housing based
on marital status.
    Lattanzi and Tarail never saw
the apartment. They ended up
moving to a $500-a-month apart-
ment and filing complaints with
the Massachusetts Commission
Against Discrimination.

Complaints credited
    In August 1990, the commis-
sion credited the complaints. A
month later, the state attorney
gFeneral filed suit on behalf of
 arail and Lattanzi charging
Desilets and his brother, Ronald,
47, who is co-owner of the build-
ing~ with violating anti-discrimi-
nation laws.
    The brothers are represented
by attorneys from the American
Center for Law and Justice, a
Virginia Beach-based law and
education group founded by
Christian broadcaster Pat Rob-
ertson in 1991. Its national net-
work of lawyers is dedicated to
"Christian advocacy and the pro-
motion of pro-liberty; pro-life
and pro-family causes.
    Arguing that sex without mar-
riage ~s against the dictates of his
Catholic faith, Paul Desilets says
he simply exercised his constitu-
tionally guaranteed freedom to
practice his religion when he
refused to rent to Lattanzi and
Tarail.
 In 1992, the landlords won the
