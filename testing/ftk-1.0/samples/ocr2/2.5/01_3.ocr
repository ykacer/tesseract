  United States, that Ma/thcs (1931) has adopted that name for the~t
  epoch in the Yosemite region. For the present, however, it seems b
  to retain a local name; and none of the names available seems more
  able than Tioga, for a glacier of this age occupied Tioga Pass anl~i~
  lobes descended both southwest and northeast therefrom, leaving chares

      The glacial features that were made by the ice tongues of the Ti~
  epoch are even now almost as fresh and unaltered as at the time of thmr~
  formation. The cirques are still as bare and ragged as if recently al)a~'~
 doned by the ice. Talus cones are few and small where the rocks are not~
 closely jointed, and have not grown to large size even where the cl~[~i
 spacing of joints is favorable to frost action. The original polished
 striated surface is still rather generally intact, even on such easily weath,~
 ered rocks as coarse granite. Acres of polished and grooved rock are ai~
 familiar sight near Tenaya Lake (Yosemite National Park) and many
 other places in the high Sierra. If it were not for the destructive etlec~ :~
 of forest fires, such surfaces would be even more completely preserved.
     The lateral moraines generally stand out as bold embankments, marred"
 only by a few landslides and by sharp ravines where tributary brooke
 descend the canyon sides. The terminal moraines are still complete, ez-
 cept for V-shaped notches through which the main streams tumble
 down to the plains beyond. As the distinctive glacial topography of the
 moraines is almost entirely preserved, it is generally an easy task to map
 them continuously.                                             '        ~                · ~
 Most of the valleys that were inhabited by glaciers of the fourth epoch '5
 now contain clear lakes 50 to 300 feet deep, some of which are a mile or ~
 more in length. The bouldery slopes commonly descend steeply into the
water. Deltas at the upper ends of these lakes have grown forward only :'
a small fraction of the original length of the lake. and the outlet streamJ
have incised their morainic dams only 10-75 feet. Fallen Leaf Lake,
near Lake Tahoe, held in by a compound loop of terminal moraines, is the
largest lake of this type on the eastern slope of the range. Independence, '
Convict, and Donner lakes are similar. Only a few of the smaller and
shallower lakes of this age have already disappeared. The rock-bound
mountain tarns in the upper parts of the glacial troughs, largely sur-
rounded by bare ice-scored rock mounds, are in substantially the same
condition now as when the glaciers left them.
