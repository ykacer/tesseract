of spa fault is that of a tear fault, with horizontal movement
of the upper plate translated during folding into lateral tear
,,c:vemant on the steep fault. Later downward movement has also
occurred on the Fall Canyon fault zone. Similarly the Thimble
fal, ult acted as a break-away fault during folding, anJ along it
?De upright wood Canyon Formation and much of the Zabriskle
~lartzlte were down-faulted eastward beneath the upper plate.
'Tl,~is accounts for the absence of the WoodCanyon Formation and
4~(:)st of the Zabrlskie in plates of the Titus Canyon fault.
             The eastern limit of pull-away of the upper limb dur-
lng folding must have been at or near the north-trending valley
on the east flank of Thimble Peak. East of that valley the Bo-
nanza King rests In conformable stratigraphlc succession on the
carrara Formation. Everywhere west and northwest of that vai-
 l,my the Bonanza King Is faulted against older beds.
             Evidence concerning the age of the folding with ac-
 companying lag faulting Is somewhat ambiguous. Southwest of
 Leadfleld, beds of the OIIgocene Titus Canyon Formation are
 faulted against beds of the Bonanza King along some faults that
 do not extend into the lower plate. This might suggest thlt
 folding end faulting could be at least as young as OI!gocene.
 Other bounding faults, however, do extend through the upper
 plate into the lower. Because attitudes of Titus Canyon beds
 in the fault blocks are discordant with underlying Cambrian
 beds, dipping In opposite directions on one block, It Il im-
 probable that the beds were tilted at a common time during fold-
 ing and leg-faulting. Rather, it is likely that the faults
