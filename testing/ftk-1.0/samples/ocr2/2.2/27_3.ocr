the conglomerate progressively bevels the Aztec Sandstone, the Chinle For-
mation, and the Moenkopi Formation. Thick wedges of coarse conglom-
erate higher in the formation show by northward thinning and decreasing
coarseness that an important source was in an area to the south where vol-
canic rocks and related intrusive bodies now form the chief outcrops.

    Above the basal conglomerate the Thumb Formation consists of reddish
sandstone and siltstone, conglomerate, fresh-water limestone, gypsum, and
thin-bedded flagstone, with a total thickness of 2,ooo to 3,000 feet. Basalt
flows and tuffaceous beds are included locally. Numerous large lenses of
breccia, made up of Precambrian gneiss, schist, and granite, are seen at many
horizons of the section; these lenses are as much as 300 feet thick, and some
are more than half a mile long. Probably they represent landsliding from
growing scarps south and east of the basin of deposition (Longwell, I95I,
p. 352). Toward the northeast, outcrops of the formation are interrupted
by a cover of younger deposits.

    Nothing analogous to the Overton Fanglomerate occurs in association
with the Thumb Formation.

    Overton Fanglomerate. The Overton Fanglomerate as originally de-
i:aed (Longwell, i92i, p. 52) included the Willow Tank and Baseline For-
mations. Later (Longwell, i949, p. 930, these formations were given sepa-
rate status and the name Overton Fanglomerate was restricted to the thick
section of coarse deposits resting unconformably on the Baseline Sandstone
and older formations. The redefined Overton, made up largely of carbon-
ate fragments derived from Paleozoic formations, has crude bedding in
which large blocks, many of them tens of feet long, have disordered arrange-
ment. It is steeply tilted to the east and has been bevelled by erosion through
its entire thickness, which at a maximum exceeds 2,oo0 feet. Apparently this
coarse debris accumulated as coalescent fans in front of an advancing thrust
sheet, which moved eastward across a strongly folded belt.

    Southwest of Logandale the basal part of the formation, with average
thickness about mo feet, consists of conglomerate made up of stream-worn
?cbbles and cobbles. This deposit grades upward into sandstone and silt-
stone, tan-colored and greenish, which locally contains small shells of gastro-
pods and fragments of fossil wood. This unit, more than 2oo feet thick,
grades upward into a similar thickness of stream-laid gravel, which in turn
grades into coarse fan deposits as much as 1,5oo feet thick. East of Glendale
these deposits enclose a mass of Kaibab Limestone more than half a mile
long and fully a quarter of a mile from a possible source in bedrock. West
of Logandale an intact block of Mississippian limestone about x,8oo feet long,
