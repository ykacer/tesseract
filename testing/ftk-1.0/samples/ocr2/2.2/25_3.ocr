by means of the Green's function and product
solution method (see Ref. 14). The result is

~hcre iDA represents the dimensionless time based
on the drainage area:

The pressure drop on the fracture for a vertical
fracture at the center of a square (xe --),e and Xu --
u) is then given by

The pressure drops on the fracture for a uniform
flux fracture and for an infinite-conductivity fracture
are obtained bv evaluating Eq. 29 at xD = 0 and
xt0 -- 0.732, respectively. The choice of the same
point as in the infinite case leads to reasonable
results and can be justified a poster:or: by the
method of desuperpos:t:on, presented later in this
paper. Numerical values of the dimensionless
