 150 women in US to test
 RU-486 as contraceptive
 San Francisco study polarizes sides in abortion fight

S    AN FRANCISCO - On the morning after',
     or even as late as five days after' unpro-
tected sex, 150 women will walk ()ne by
one into a room at San Francisco General
Hospital, swallow up to three white pills
and become the first Americans to test the French
abortion drug, RU-486, as an emergency contracep-
tive.
    Calling the clinical trials "a new era in reproduc-
tive research for women," Dr. David A. Grimes, the
principal investigator, said that ii' the landmark
study is successful, RU-486 or a similar drug could
reduce the need for abortion.
    "And that's a cause everyone should rally around
regardless of their beliefs," said Grimes, who began
last week searching for volunteers. In the first 24
hours after the study's announcement Tuesday, 80
women called before his clogged answering machine
automatically shut down.
    According to the nurse who is screening volun-
teers, the callers are married as well as single, and
range in age from 18 through their 40s. They tell of
broken condoms and moments of passion that made
them skip birth control "just this once."
    But even as some women clamored for the drug,
which has not been approved for' mm'keting in the
United States, Richard Glasow of the antiabortion
National Right to Liib Committee, said women were
being misled into thinking of RU-486 as an emergen-
cy contraceptive, when in fact it is an abortion pill.
    "The proposed testing of RU-486 as a contracep-
tive is fundamentally misleading," Glasow said, "be-
cause it works not to prevent contraception but to
cause abortion."
    Glasow and many other opponents of abortion
maintain that human life begins the moment the
sperm joins with the egg.
    However, Grimes, professor of obstetrics and gy-
necology at the University of California at San Fran-
cisco, said that most scientists consider a woman
pregnant when a fertilized egg becomes implanted in
her uterus, which occurs up to two weeks after fertil-
ization. Thus, very early use of the drug would be
preventing, not ending, pregnancy.
    "The pill works before pregnancy has started,"
Grimes said.
    Glasow said that researchers in this study were
attempting to repackage RU-486 as a contraceptive
to help promote the drug's legalization in the United
States.
  Only Britain, France, China and Sweden allow

mainly used to induce abortion in women in the ear'-
liest weeks of pregnancy, although it has begun to be
used as a morning-after contraceptive in Britain.
    This new study, sponsored by the World Health
Organization with the approval of the IlS Food and
Drug Administration, jumps ahead of a long-awaited
US trial of RU-486 as an abortion pill.
    The drug is already being studied elsewhere in
the United States for other uses, including as a
treatment for' fibroid tumors and endometriosis, and
as an alternative to chemotherapy for women with
breast cancer.
    Although Roussel-Uclaf, the French manufactur-
er of RU-486, has agreed to US tests of the pill for
abortion use, negotiations have dragged on for more
than a year with the Population Council, a New
York-based research group Roussel has chosen as
its licensee.
    That delay comes on top of a history of reluc-
tance by Roussel to tangle ~ith the Reagan and
Bush adnfinistrations' antiabortion stance and with
right-to-life groups, which have threatened to boy-
cott products of Hoechst Celanese Corp., the US
subsidiary of Roussel-Uclafs parent company,
Hoeschst AG of Germany.
    The San Francisco study, in which RU-486 x~411
be supplied by Roussel, probably would not have
been possible without the Clinton administration's
decision last year to encourage research into RU-486
that could lead to FDA approval.
    Overlooked in the controversy over RU-486,
Grimes said, is the fact that so-called postcoital con-
traception is already available to American women.
    Two tablets of a birth control pill called Owal
taken within 72 hours of having sex and two more
pills 12 hours later have been proven effective in
preventing pregnancy, Grimes said. But women who
follow this morning-after pill regimen experience un-
pleasant side effects, including vomiting, which is
why interest has focused on RU-486, he said.
    The San Francisco study is part of a larger inter-
national effort to determine the minimum effective
dosage of RU-486 as an emergency contraceptive.
Although studies in Britain have shox~m that 600 mil-
ligrams of RU-486 in three pills can prevent preg-
nancy, researchers suspect a lower dosage, with few
side effects, can also be effective.
    If the drug fails and the women become preg-
nant, they will be offered abortions at no cost.
    Potentially, the drug could gain approval by the
Food and D~-ag Administration as an emergency
contraceptive before it is approved as an abortion
pill. Once a drug is approved, it may be used hy doc-
