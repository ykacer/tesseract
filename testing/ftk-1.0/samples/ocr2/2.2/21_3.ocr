dispersed joints have been modeled [Snow,
1965], a few examples of which arc shown here
in stereograhie projections. Systems of ally
desired complexity can be generated by com-
bining individual dispersions differing in direc-
tion of central tendency, dispersion coefficient,
or si)acing. Plate 1 shows the change of aniso-
tropy for a single set having a given dispcrsion
as tile sample size changes. Plate 2 shows the
effect of decreasing orientation dispersion from
Fisher's Kr = 6 to 60. Plate 3 treats two ortho-
gonal sets, Plate 4 two nonorthogonal sets, and
Plate 5 three orthogonal sets.
    In any one model, spacing has been main-
rained by proportioning tile sample size of each
set according to equation 26 anti Figure 5.
    Also displayed in stereographic lirojection are
the princiI/al permeability axes for 49 sampl-
ings, disclosing the range of possiblc solutions.
Orthogonal triplets of dimnonds, circles, and
crosses correspond to maximum, intermediate,
and minimum permeability axes. The scatter
simulates the variation in principal permeability
axes that must exist from one place to another
in jointed rock. The axes close on mean direc-
tions as tile sample size or vohunc increases.
Dispersion of the axes would be concealed by
mean values, using only large salnples. ~ote
that aberrant axial orientations are possible
from ~ random model, as illustrated iii Plate 1,
Figure 3, by the minor axis (cross) oriented
N 78°W, 30° from the vertical. Ifa sample
contains one large opening it will dominate the
dircctional permeability just, :ts an open fault
will dominate tile tlow in a region.
    Distribution curves of princil)al permealfili-
tics are plotted. Diamonds, circles, and crosses
maintain correspondence of princilial axes and
l)ermeabilities. Sitice the maximum, interme-
diate, and minimum permeabilities were ranked
separately for cunmlatve l)lotting, the three
values found at any onc ordinate do not con-
stitute a particular solution. To preserve in-
divklual relationslfips, on the right of the
permeability plots tile cumulative distrilmtion
of nmximum anisotropies has been plotted, each
being the ratio of minimum permeability to
maximum permeability for ,~ particular solu-
tion.
     The dispersion of principal pcrmeabilities is
 portrayed in Plate 1. The large dispersions com-
 lmted are consistent with tile large observed

variations in mcasm'cd pcrmeabilities itl jointed
rocks, reflecting dellcndencc upon the Cllbe of
variablc apcrtm'e. The dispersions of principal
axes (Plate 1, Figm'es 3 -md 5) anti penne- '
abilities (Ptatc 1, Figures 4 and 6) dccrease
for saml)les of increasing size (100 and 500
joints, respectively), :ts anticipated from the
central limit theorem, l'rincipal axes are con-
centrated within about 10° and 5° of are for
tile 100 and 500 conduit samples, respec-
tively. Median permeability values increase
slightly with s:lmple size as shown in tile smn-
nmry plot (Figure 2). Studies have indicated
that model permeability is well-defined for 100
or more joints; otherwise it is a function of size.
    The stereographic projections of principal
axes display three of the quantitics required to
define a second rank tensor, and the cumulative
permeabilily plots display tile other three. Tiros
each pair of plols should be read together. Cer-
tain mutual rehtionshil)s are evident. If two
principal permeabilities are nearly the same
each time a sample is taken, then their axial
orientations are sensitive to differences in the
conductors in the samples. Since any two equal
ortlmgonal lmrmeability vectors define a plane
of isotropy, we find that successive solutions for
a single set of dispersed joint oricnt'dions scatter
orientations throughout a great circle of the
stereonet, such as the equatorial planes of Fig-
ures 3 and 5 of Plate 1. The normal to the plane
of isotropy is the only mfique l)rincipal axis, as
is tile optic axis of a mtiaxial ruiner'cl. Figures
4 and 6 of l'lale I show slight differences be-
tween princilml permcabilities on tile isotrolfiC
Iff:me (maximum aim internmdiate l~ermeabili-
tics), whereas lhe inlermingling of diamonds
and circles on the girdle in the stereogram indi-
cates statistical isotropy, especially for large
samples.
     Sheeted granite is a prototype of a single
 set of joints, l'late 2 illustrates the effect of de-
 creasin~ oricntation dispersion of a single set of
 joints. The joint polmlations for Fisher's Kt =
 6 to 60 are shown, as well as the principal axes
 and l)ennealJilities for samples of size 92 to 106,
 varying according to equation 26 to maintain a
 sample volume of 1035 cm cubed for a jointed
 medium of inverse specific surface 10 em. As
 orientation dispersion decreases, there is pro-
 gressive reduclion nf the dispersion of axes and

    It is rarer to find only two sets of joints in
rock than to find one or three sets. Two ortho-
gonal joint sets of equal properties are repro-
sonic(1 in Plate 3, Figure 1. l'rincipal axes shown
in l'late 3, Figure 2, indic'de that the central
tendencies of normals (o two sots of orthogonal

joints of like properties lie on a plane of near
isolropy, even for small samples. The unique
major axis contains the central plane of each
set, in other words, lies parallel to the predomi-
nant direction of intersections. Permeability in
the isotropie plane is half the value in the direc-
tion of the intersection.
    When the two orthogonal sets differ, as in
Plale 3, Figure 4, three unique axes appear, one
par.qllcl to tile eentr.d normal of each set. Tile
