Dear Friends:

         It's that time of year for us to prepare for our annual
Autumnfest Fundraiser to be held on the parish grounds
October 22, 23 & 24, 1993! Once again this year we will be
publishing an Ad Brochure that is sure to be more excizing
and profitable for everyone involved.

         The ad brochure will be distributed to our i450 parish
families and will also be available throughout the weekend
for everyone who attends Autumnfest.

         This past year we completed the construction of our new
church facilities, thanks to the generosity of many people
such as yourself. Our~ goal for zne Autumnfest this year is
to t'aise enough money, reduce the balance of our building debt
and begin to plan the next phase of construction, offlces and
meeting rooms for our parish.

         On behalf of all the people at Prince of Peace, I thank
you again for your $ 25.00 contribution ]asr year for a
quarter page advertisement in our brochure. Can we count on
your support again t:his year? We enclose nn order form eot
your convenience.    If you have already sent ns an ad for this
year's book, we thank you very much.

Yours sincerely in Christ,

Rev. Francis Timoney
       Pastor
