where i and J are unit vectors in the x. and y-directions,
respectively, and the sign depends on the orientation of the
extra atomic plane forming the dislocation.
    Edge dislocations move easdy only in their slip /or
glide} plane. Motion perpendicular to the slip plane by
climb requires transport of vacancms or mterstitials to or
from the bulk of the solid to the dislocation line by
diffusion. Point defect migration under most conditions is
Aow because the concentrations of vacancies or interstitials
is qwte Iow. However, at temperatures above roughly
one-half the melting point t:K} or in a radiation field,
~ufficient point defects are present and their mobility is
great enough to permit edge dislocation climb to take place
at measurable rates. The climb process is of primary
importance m the slow plastic deformation mechanism
known as creep, which profoundly affects the performance
of reactor fuel elements.
    The force causing climb is not restricted to external
stresses applied to the solid, as shown in Fig. 8.10b. The
internal stress due to the presence of other nearby
dislocations or to the creation of high point defect
supersaturatmn bt' radiation can 'also induce climb of tile
edge portions of dislocations I Chap. 16. Sec. 16.7i.
    A similar analysis can be applied to a screw dislocation.
Figure ~,.11 shows a screw dislocation of length S which
expenences a force per unit length F in the slip direction
due to an applied shear stress crv,. Tile subscripts on the
shear stress indicate that it acts in the slip plane iwhich is
perpendicular to the y-axis~ and in tile direction of the

z-ax~s. Note that in this case the force on the dislocation
line is at right angles to the direction of the applied stress
that produces the force. If the screw dislocauon moves a
distance Ax in the x direction, an area S Ax slips by
a distance b in the slip direction Ithe z-directionL The work
done by the applied stress is lo,.,S-kx)b. Equating this
quantity of work to a force on the dislocation line acting in
the x-direction times the distance tile line moves, we find
the force on a unit length of screw dislocation produced by
the shear stress to be

As in the case of stresses acting on edge dislocations, choice
of ~ or -- in Eq. 8.14 depends on the sign of the dislocation
li.e., whether the screw is left-handed or right-handed).
    The dependence or' the direction of the force exerted
by a shear stress on the sign of both edge and screw
dislocations implies that the dislocation loop shown in
Fig. 8.6 can be made to expand uniformly m the radial
direction by a shear force in the direction of the arrow in
the drawing. The x-direction force exerted on the edge
component at A is *O'xyb, and the edge component at C is
subject to a force -cJ~vb. Similarly. the y-direction forces
on the screw components at B and D are *o~,.b and -r;x,.b,
respectively.
    Tensile or compressive stresses produce no force on a
screw dislocation, which is incapable of movement by
climb.

8.5 MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES OF
    DISLOCATIONS

8.5.1 Density of Dislocation Lines

    The concentration of dislocation lines in a solid is
measured by the number of dislocation lines that penetrate
a unit area within the crvstal. This quantity, which is
known as the dislocation density, ranges from ~104
dislocations em' in high.purity carefully prepared semicon-
ductor single crystals lgermanium or silicon} to ~10~
