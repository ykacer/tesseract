1963 (see Table 2) and is not included in the consumptive use shown. Water
added to the tamks was adjusted for changes in soil moisture during the month.
The depth to water was held between 5 and 6 ft below land surface.
    As a result of the general increase of vegetation in each of the tanks,
water use during 1964 greatly exceeded that used during 1963. The pattern of
vegetation development was not the same for each tank, however, so the rela-
tion between data for pairs of individual tanks was continually changing. Ill
1965, the plants were approaching maturity, and the volume of vegetation
increased only slightly.
    A search of the literature indicated that water-use data for arrowwecd
were lacking prior to the current studies at Yuma. The data now available
indicate thai under favorable conditions, arrowweed will use as much water
as saltcedar, which has long been known for its high rate of water use.
    S(tltbt~sh.--Quailbrush (Atriplex lentiformis) was grown ill tanks 1 and 2.
and four-wing saltbush (Atrtplex canescens) was grown ill tank 3. The salt-
bush was established both by transplanting and seeding. Depth to water was
held at 3 to 4 ft below land surface, in 1962, and nearly constant at 5.5 ft
during 1963 and 1964.
    The quailbrush made most of its growth during 1963, the average volume
of the two tanks increasing from 1,050 cu ft in December, 1962, to 5,650 cu
ft in October, 1963. Although the average volume of vegetation increased to
6,240 cuft by September, 1964, and 7,030 by August 6, 1965, the volume of
foliage actively transpiring may have been less (see Fig. 3). Growth in tank
1 was more vigorous than in tank 2 during 1964. The consumptive use, shown
in Table 8, does not include precipitation but is adjusted for soil-lnoisture
changes during the month.
     Four-wing saltbush, grown in tank 3, is smaller and slower in growth than
 quailbrush. This plant will exist as a xerophyte, but appears to grow and pro-
 duce seed only when moisture is sufficient to meet nfinimum needs. The
 greatest growth of vegetation in the tank was made during 1963. when the
 volume increased from 1,290 to 2,290 cu ft. The volume was 2,770 cuft on
 September 24, 1964, and 3,080 on August 6, 1965. The water use, shown in
 Table 8 and Fig. 4, was significantly less during 1964 and 1965, essentially
 because of the maturation of tile plants.
     Cattail.--Cattail grows to maturity and dies each season, hi the Yuma
 area, growth begins in March and ends in July; vegetation begins to dies il:
 October and usually is dry by December. The tanks for cattail were set well
 within an extensive area of similar vegetation. Cattail transplanted late in
 the 1961 growing season made little growth during the remainder of tile year
 During 1962 and following years, however, the cattail grew normally in thc
 tanks, attaining an average height of 6 to 7 ft each year.
     Water was added to the tanks at least twice each week, reestablishing rite
 water level at a point 2 to 4 in. above the roots of the plants. Water xv:~
 changed once each week to prevent tile accumulation of salts. Except for th~.
 vegetation ill tank 3 during 1964, as will be explained subsequently, cat:t:~il
 in the tal2<s blended well with that of the surrounding area (see Fig. 5).
     Consumptive use from tank 1 showed no progressive increase or decre:t :c
 during tile 3 yr, as indicated by Table 9 and Fig. 6. The appearance of i',~c
 vegetation was about tile same each year. Tile condition of the vegetatJgn ~
 tank 2 was noticeably improved during 1964 relative to previous years, a ~ct
 the higher use from this tank during 1964 is associated with this change. 2'~
