Nitrogen Dioxide and Dinitrogen Tetroxide                                     263

is reversible at approximately 400°. It appears that certain nitrites are not affected
by liquid dinitrogen tctroxide,~: and that the oxidation to nitrate which occurs at
high temperature is in fact due to atomic oxygen produced by collision of the nitrogen
dioxide molecules xxith thc ~urfacc of the nitrite, yielding nitric oxide at the same
time. Any n~tr~tc ~hich decomposes may appear to react, o',~,ing to thc reaction of
the products of the dccomposition.:°:
    The induced decomposition of hyponitrites has been reported to take place at 0°
in the presence of mtrogen dioxide?2 The reactions that occur are those found in
the thermal decomposmon of hyponitrites:

These results appear to be quite different from those of Addison, Gamlen and
Thompson>C3 ~ho find that unlike nitrite and nitrate, hyponitrit, and oxyhypo-
mtrlt¢ (Na~_N,OD are immediately oxidized by liquid mtrogen dioxide.
    The expios~ve dccomposmon of trieth>lammonmm nitrate and nitrogen dioxide
m~xtures has been mentioned~°4 and the reaction cf sodamide with nitrogen dioxide
m carbon tetrachtoride solutmn has been shown to result in the production of the

           The Action of Nitrogen Dioxide on Metals

     Nitrogen dioxide readily attacks many metals and several papers describing such
 reactions are of a technical nature. Earlier work indicated that nitrogen dioxide
 attacks ~ron and OCLO~pcr,ia6' io7 and it was later suggested~°8 that i~

The imeraction of nitrogen dioxide with atomic sodium results in a powerful chemi-

    Frequently the reaction of nitrogen dioxide in the liquid phase with a metal results
in thc formation of an adt,.erent film ~hich slows down any subsequent reaction.
This ~s apparently not so with zinc and hence the reaction with this element has been
thoroughly examined. The alkali metals react rapidly and controllably ~ith liquid
dinitrogen tetroxide to yield the corresponding nitrates but no nitrite? Zinc reacts
readily with nitrogen dioxide to give a white crystalline solid, insoluble in nitrogen
dioxide, and having the formula Zn(NOj):,2N.O4.*~a At 100° the pure anhydrous
nitrate is formed. The kinetics of this reaction have been examinedTM as has the
effect of the addition of dinitrogen trioxide or nitrosyl chloride. In the former case
no additional compounds are formed, althou~.h the rate of reaction is increased.~ta
With nitrosyl chloride, depending on the conditions of reaction, it is possible to
obtain the chloride or the nitrate, sometimes solvated)~6

Zinc reacts with these solutions to yield a r;:d liquid, immiscible with nitrogen
dioxide,:'e ~hich is the same as the soiution obtained by dissolving Zn(NOj)-2N.-O4
