     The Cloverdale district includes the southernYpart of the Sho-

 to about 8 miles north, including bolh East and West Golden. The
 district also includes the area near the Orizaba mine, which is on
 a spur off the northern Cedar Mountains and is about 5 miles air
 line southwest of the Cioverdale Ranch.
    The district is about 40 miles by road from either Tonopah or
Mina. Condition of the routes depends on the part of the district;
from East Golden and Cloverdale the route to 'l'onopah is usually
preferred, while from the Orizaba secti(m the Mina road is ordi-

springs in the area usually within a slmrt distance of the prop-
erties. The California Electric Company's line to Gabbs passes
between the Cloverdale Ranch ami the Orizaba mine and is there-
fore within a short distance of the mining properties.
