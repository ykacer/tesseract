in the precious metals, which seem to have been deposited along with
the sqica, since the quartz appears to carry most of the values. Ap-
parently before the limestone was replaced it was completely recrys-
tallized to a cleavable mass or aggregate of large white to colorless
calcite crystals, the incomplete outlines of which at many places
grade irregularly ~nto the massive limestone. Subsequently silica-
bearing waters replaced the calcite crystals. Specimens collected in
the Manhattan Consolidated mine illustrate well the various transi-
tion stages in the replacement of individual calcite crystals by quartz.
In some specimens there appears to be only a thin film of quartz
enveloping a part or the whole of a c .rystal. Again, the silica is found
to have penetrated irregularly for short distances along a few of the
cleavage planes of the calcite, while in other specimens nearly all the
numerous cleavage partings are filled with silica, clthough calcite
remains between the thin siliceous films. Still other specimens show
that the calcite which formerly intervened between these films has
been partially or entirely replaced by silica. In many instances the
siliceous pseudomorphs after the calcite are rather porous, the silica
having failed to replace all of the calcite taken into solution. '
    The replacement of calcite by silica has proceeded most extensively
along the contacts of the limestone with other formations, or along
bedding planes and joints in the limestone itself.

         DISPLACEMENTS ALONG TIIE FISSURES.

A large number of fractures along which movement has occurred
traverse the metamorphosed sedimentary rocks.
    Evidence of movement is found in the soft, claylike "gouge"
which at some places fills both barren and productive fractures.
The gouge in one or two instances reached a width of nearly 4 feet, 4
while the country rock was crushed and brecciated for several feet
on either side of the fracture. Polished or slickensided surfaces
showing steeply inclined (50° to 75°) movement stri~e are also of
frequent occurrence.
    On account of the snow and the limited time devoted to the study
of the area it was impossible to determine the amount of displace-
ment resulting from the movements, but by detailed mapping of
the most prominent and easily recognizable lilnestone, quartzite,
and shale beds both the direction of the faults and the amount of
displacement of the beds can probably be ascertained.
    To what extent faulting has occurred sivce the deposition of the
ore is at present undeterminable on account of the limited explo-
ration along even the more promising veins. However, a fault
which has caused a displacement of only a few feet cuts one of the
mineralized fissures on the Stray Dog claim. Again, near the south-
east boundary of Union No. 9 claim there is an irregularity in tho
