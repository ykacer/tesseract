(Figure 2c), an area of stagnant water is
formed. A high accumulation of mineral con-
stituents is probable at these places. Below such
a stagnant body of groundwater, flow occurs
again and may result in a better quality of
water than that from shallower depths.
    7. Decreasing potential with depth in re-
charge areas and incre~ing imtential in dis-
charge areas are direct consequences of the the-
ory and can be observed in all diagrams of
Figure 2. It should be noted, however, that such
a configuration of the equipotential lines is pro-
nounced only in the immediate vicinities of the
highs and lows. The midlines and their vicinities
are locations of relatively straight, vertical equi-
potential lines.
    8. From Figure 2 it can safely be stated that
the major stream of the basin receives ground-
water contributions only from the adjacent
topographic highs and from possible regional
flow. The latter is probably unimportant in
most eases because of the low rate of flow. It
is conceivable, then, tlmt the methods in which
baseflow data are used for computation of b~in-
wide characteristics (average recharge, permea-
bility, etc.) are nfisleading or erroneous. Even

if the two llanks of a basin are of low relief, ,.
that there are no local systems, the bulk of 0
basin discharge will take pl~e between the mi~
line and tlle valley bottom and only a small per
tion will appear as baseflow.
    9. A further consequence of tile theory.
that the water levels at shallow depths are ti
most affected by season'd recharge and di
charge. The small intake and outlet areas of t~
intermediate and regional zones prevent t~.
water levels from fluctuating widely. Plotnikc
and Bogomolov [1958, p. 90] make a distint
tion between two zones on tile basis of fiuetua
tion of the water levels. They call thc first 'zor
of oscillations of underground water levels.' A~
cording to them the volume of water that occu
pies the zone of oscillation undergnes season:
variations. This vohune would control grounc
water discharge and therefore they call it 'c01
trol reserves of underground waters.' Their sec
ond zone includes all the water that is below th
zone of oscillation, both that in the deeper, st:
homogeneous parts of the basin and that i'
artesian aquifers; these are the 'secular re
sources.' It seems that the 'zone of oscillati0r
and the portion of the 'secular resources' tha
