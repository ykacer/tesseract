 communication from its remote location, prearranged short wav.e
 radio contact was made with Fallon, 80 miles distant bY road.
 When the ore was exhausted ill 1940, the operation was shut
 down and ali surface plant subsequently sold. Only the shaft,
 stopes caved to the surface, and the tailing pile remain as evi-
 dence of past activity.
     The Penelas ore occurred in two veins, both in andesite and
 rhyolite, having an average width of about 5 feet. Mining was
 (!one on nine levels spaced 100 feet al)art with al)out 4,000 feet of
 laterals. The 6th, 7th and 8th lew~ls are said to have been the
 most productive, the main ore shoot having been ~l)out 150 feet
 long. As stated by L. 1). Gordon, no values were foun(! below the
 900-foot level.

 G()l(Icn Eagle, is til~.~ southern an(I more hnl)(irtant retained part
 of several adjoining properties purchased in 1915 by the Kansas
 City-Nevada Consolidate(I Mines Company. It is situated along
 the crest of the north end of the 1)aradise Range about 15 miles
 northwest (if l(ine. The Penelas adjoins this property on the
 southeast. The present owner is Mrs. Esther Peterson of Super-
 ior, Wisconsin. The mine was last leased to John Chisholm and
 George Erwin who made periodic shipments of gold ore in 1938.
    At the Paymaster claim on the north end of th~!gr(~up the ore
occurs in a poorly defined zone along a rhyolite-andesite contact.
An excellent one and one-half compartment 375-foot shaft, with
levels each 125 feet and about 2,000 feet of laterals, was sunk prior
to 1920. Except for the collar set, the timbers show no signs of
decay and the ladders are in good condition. It is reported that
the principal values were found above the 125-foot level and that
careful selective mining was necessary. A 50-t(in cyanide mill,
built in 1919 and destroyed by fire a few years later, was appar-
ently unjustified as no recorded pro(hlction is shown for the eom-
pany. Broken ltilis, 12 miles west, was probably the principal
source of ore for the mill. Little or no work has been done on the
Paymaster since about 1923.
    The July Lode, at the south end, is the only part of the property
having an appreciable production. It is from here that O!e Peter-
son and !ea~rs are said to have produced about $70,000 in the
years 1936 to 1944. The ore occurence here is different from the
Paymaster in that quartz is more abundant and the ratio of gold
to silver is much greater. The values are found in a brecciated
rhyolite recemented with quartz and occurring'ina chimney-like
ore shoot approximately 14 feet by 8 feet in cr/~Ss-section which
