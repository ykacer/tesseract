Need for Thermal Analysis

     Many aspects of waste package design and testing depend in part on the
temperature environment to which the emolaced packages will be exposed.
Information oroduced by thermal analysis is needed for the following reasons.

             To demonstrate [nat designs w~ll not exceed maximum temperature
             criteria For ~ne various waste forms: 773 K (500°C) for Defense High
             Level Waste (0HLW) glass, 673 K (400°C) for Commercial Hign Level
             Naste (CHLW) g ass, and 623 K (350°C) for Spent Fuel (SF);

     o      To provide projected temperature histories for materials selection;

             To assist in the verification of the performance analysis code, NAPPA

             -II;'

             To provide temperature boundary conditions for tne performance
             analysis code;

             To provide the temperature environment for transportation, nanoiing,
             storage and retrieval analyses;

             To calculate approximate tilde periods of steam/water contact Nitn
             waste package;

      o    To provide temperature histories for corrosion testing;

      o      To provide temperature nistories for waste form leach testing;

             To provide temperature histories and boundary conditions for very
             near field steam/air/water porous flow calculations;

* (WAPPA is a one-dimensional code designed to calculate the corrosion and
leaching of the various waste package components and to calculate the eventual
~reacning and the release rate to the repository. WAPPA consists of five
process suumodels including the radiation, thermal, mechanical, corrosion and
leach submodels).
