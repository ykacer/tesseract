Dear Mr. Nartker:

Ail the great man-made structures were built the same way--one step
at a time. And while some fortunes are made "overnight", most are
the result of consistent disciplined investing and compounding.

Mutual funds offer a flexible, easy and affordable way to
accumulate money for your future.     Low minimums, automatic
investment programs and easy access to your money are just a few
reasons why one in four U.S. households own mutual funds (Source:
Investment Company Institute).

A finely-tuned investment program takes the guessing out of
investing, and helps determine whether you'll succeed in achieving
your financial goals. I've assisted many of my clients get started
and I'd like the opportunity to assist you, too. I think you'll
both be pleased and impressed with some of the techniques you can
use.

I look forward to helping you to start building your "fortune."
I'll be calling you soon.

Sincerely,j

Doreen A. Caesar
