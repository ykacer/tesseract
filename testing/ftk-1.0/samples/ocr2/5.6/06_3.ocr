Discrimination Can pervade brotherhood of badge

    It happened to Herbert Sharp soon
after he was hired as a Rocky Hill police
officer in 1989.
    He was living in Hartford, so he went
to Rocky Hill one evening to drive
around and learn the layout of his new
beat.
    But he learned something else in-
stead. Sharp, who is black, was followed
for miles by a white police officer until
he left Rocky Hill.

    "If you're black and in a neighbor-
hood, then you're suspicious," said
Sharp, 28, the town's only black police
officer.
    Sharp and eight other black and His-
panic police officers interviewed thi~
month said they were not surpr;sed b~
recent disclosures that some Avon offi-
cers had targeted black and Hispanic
motorists for motor vehicle stops. They
said it has happened to them.
    Four (~ther minority officers inter-
viewed said they have not been stopped
without cause by other officers. All the
officers interviewed were chosen ran-

domly.
    Those police officers who have been
hassled said it has happened during
their off-duty hours when they drive
into the mostly white suburbs of Hart-
ford and other large cities to ilo their
shopping, banking and other errands.
The officers interviewed said they have
been hassled less frequently in recent
years, but suspect that is partly because
they are older and drive "family" cars,
such as station wagons.
    They said although only a few officers
seem to discriminate, it is a problem that
taints many suburban departments.
