SLAIN IN CROSSFIRE
 - ON HIS BIRTHDAY

Was waiting to shoot
hoops with his buddies

 By LINDA MASSARELLA

    A Bronx man cele-
brating his 29th birth-
day with friends was
killed yesterday --
caught in a crossfire be-
tween feuding gangs,
police said.
    David Eehevarria was
the 81st person shot by
random gunfire this year
-- and the third in four
days, police say.

    His last words to his
girlfriend were: "I love
you."
 And, in a scene eerily
reminiscent of              the
movie "Ghost,"              To-
masita Carvallo             told

The Post she respond-
ed: "Ditto."
    Echevarria, a restau-
rant manager, was hav-
ing a beer with friends
in a playground at
183rd Street and Ryer
Avenue in the Fordham
section at about 1 a.m.
    "He was listening to
music, waiting for his
turn to play basket-
ball," Police Sgt. An-
drea Herzberg said.
    Suddenly, a fight
broke out between two
gangs -- and shots were
fired, she said.
    Echevarria was hit
twice in the head and
died instantly.
 "There were all these

shots all of a sudden,"
said a man who lives
across the street.
 "I didn't look out - no
way, I'm not               that
stupid," he said.
    Echevarria "was a
good guy -- he worked,
he stayed with his girl-
friend," said a friend,
Henry Gonzales.
    But, because it was
his birthday, Echevar-
ria "wanted to cele-
brate,'' Gonzales said.
    Carvallo told The
Post that Echevarria
had gone downstairs to
play cards and came
back to their apartment
around midnight.
    "He was bored, he still
wanted to do some-
thing," she said.
    "So he went to play
basketball."
    That's when he told
her he loved her and

walked out the door.
    "I just want him
back," she sobbed.
    Residents say this
wasn't the first time an
innocent victim was
killed by a stray bullet
in their neighborhood.
    "About 12 people have
been killed like this
over the past two or
three years," said 50-
year-old Juan Rivera.
    "The police [station
house] is just two blocks
from here, and we
never see enough cops.
    "The neighborhood is
being overrun with
drug dealers," he said.
"How can we live like
this?"
    On Tuesday, Michelle
McKie, a 14-year-old
honor student, lost her
eye after she was hit
outside her high school
in Queens.
    And on Sunday, Tessa
Warren was killed by a
stray    bullet    fired
through the window of
her    apartment    in
Brooklyn as a basket-
ball fan sprayed the
area with bullets in
celebration of a Knicks
victory.
    "It highlights the gun
problem that we have
in this city and in this
country," Police Com-
 missioner             William
 Bratton said.

  ECHEVARRIA
Innocent bystander.
