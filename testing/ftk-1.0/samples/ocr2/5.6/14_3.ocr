Age of

It ain't kid stuffwhen 6 wins

AFTER HE WON the
$6,000, 6*year-old Dom-
inick Caggiano an-
nounced plans to place half
of it in a church poor box.
    His parents certainly ad-
mired his spirit but prevailed

upon him to put
the money away
until he was old
enough to appre-
ciate the magni-
tude of his lar-
gess. Whatever
age that might
be, people up at

the Hunts Point Market sure-
ly still will be telling the story
of Dominick and the 1994
basketball pool.
    The market's annual pool is
taken as seriously as the
price of arugula, and the en-
trants include people who
have spent decades studying
scores and players and
coaches. Several have been
known to bet as much as
$10,000 on a single game.
    Yet, the first round of this
year's pool found neither
Short Petey nor Fat Bubba,
or any of the other experts, in
the lead. The early leader
was instead an unknown from
C & S Produce named Domi-
nick. Several entrants were
prompted to inquire about
him at C & S, and they were
told he was the son of the
firm's founder, John Cag-
giano.
    The next round showed
Dominick still in the lead,
and the entrants became a lit-
tle more curious. They now
asked John Caggiano his
son's age. The answer
brought a universal response.
    "They didn't believe me,"
John says.
    John managed to convince
them of the truth. They recov-
ered from the shock enough
to suggest that his son must
be the luckiest 6-year-old on
earth.

had been sitting down with
the newspaper each morning
for the past year. He read
about all sports, but basket-
ball was his main game and
he was soon offering in-
formed opinions about any

number of teams.
    By last March, the father
was impressed enough to put
up $100 and enter Dominick
in the annual pool. The fa-
ther also entered himself,
and the two of them sat down
together at the kitchen table
to fill their respective sheets.
    The father mixed favorites
with underdogs for the vari-
ous rounds of the NCAA
championships. He chose
Florida to take the title.
    "I thought they could go all
the way," John says.
    Dominick decided that the
championship would come
down to Duke versus Arkan-
sas. He foresaw that Arkan-
sas would win.
    "They looked like they
were playing the best," Domio
nick says.
    The sheets were submitted ·
to those running the pool,
and over the days ahead
Dominick returned home
from first grade to learn he
had picked right again. The
end of the second round saw
him doing so well that two
men called C & S to offer
$1,000 for his sheet. The fa-
ther relayed the offer to his
son. Dominick had an imme-
diate answer.
    "He said, 'No, 2 want to
win,' "John remembers.
    Dominick kept his sheet
and stayed in the lead
through the regionals. His
fellow entrants posed anoth-
