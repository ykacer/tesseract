DISSOLUTIOM OF SPECIFIC RAD[OI(UCLIDES

4.1 IIO'ROOOCT I0#

Separate, to some extent, from the question
of the breakdown and dissolution of the glass
matrix, is the question of the leaching or
dissolution of specific elements that are
de~q~ed to be of particular importance. Those
elements of greatest significance to the long
term safety of a defense nuclear waste re-
pository are technetium, uranium, and tlqe
transuranic elements.

Technetium, uranium and the transuranic ele-
ments, with their long half lives, are the
major radtonuclides from the waste that sur-
vive well into the 'geological' time period
of the repository. ~e sections that follow
discuss experimental results on the dis-
solution of these elements from the MCC
reference gl ass.

4.2 OXIDATIOM POTEMTI.~LS IN
   DISSOLUTIOM

Many radionuclides of importance in nuclear
waste management occur in more than one va-
lence state. Usually the valenE~ states have
different solubilities.[e.g., Uv' (soluble)/
U4+ (insoluble) and Tc/+ (soluble) Tc4+
(nearly insoluble)]. The long-term leaching
be(~avior of waste forms ~11 be a function of
the stable valence states of the various
rads onucl i des.

Reactions connecting different valence states
require an exchange of electrons in the same
way that acid-base reactions require an ex-
change of protons. Since most waste forms
are oxides, these reactions can be described
by oxi~tion potentials. In a comq~lex system
such as · nuclear waste, there are many reac-
tions u~ way simultaneously. If the sys-
tem is to be at equilibrium (a situation that
is seldom obtaineq), all of these must be ad-
justed to a single oxidation potential vSnich
may be regardeq as a system master variable.

 Lindberg and Runnells(al analyzed 611 ground
 water analyses for ~mi~ a measureq Eh and at
 least one analyzed redox couple was present.
 They reacheq the conclusion that no meaning-

ful statement can be made about redox poten-
tial in low ionic strength ground waters
because all of the pertinent reactions are
out of equilibrium. Althou~ Eh can be meas-
ured, the relationship of the nun,)er obtained
to any redox reaction in the solutions is
problematic at best. The analo~ty between Eh
and pH breaks down, these authors argue,
because there is no free electron in solution
to act as an intermediary in reciox reactions
the way in which the free proton acts as the
intermediary in acid-base reactions.

The extent to ~ich nuclear waste dissolution
reactions are controlleq by Eh is still open
to debate in spite of some fairly intensive
research over the past several years. It
will be shown in this report that Eh plays an
important role in the dissolution behavior of
both technetium and uranium. The extent to
which these effects can be described quanti-
tatively and incorporated into rate equations
is still open.

4.2.1 Concepts md Oeftnttions

Redox equilibria are described in some detail
by Garrels and ~rist (1965) and Stumm and
Morgan (1981). The short section that fol-
lows sets out ~e needed equations and
defi ni ti ons.

Redox potential is usually described by Eh, a
macroscopic parameter relateq to the electron
activity. Consider the analo~LY to ~.

An equivalent parameter can be defined for
electrons.
