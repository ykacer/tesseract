    Life, as most people live it, is a
rough mixture of plans and happen-
stance, intentions and flukes, nature
and nurture, warp and weft. But his-
tory is supposed to be orderly, the-

    Transforming sloppy life into
smooth history is a difficult job, and
in the case of Richard Nixon the job
may be next to impossible. Ameri-

first televised "town meetings." He
nurtured the Republican "southern
strategy" and played a crucial transi-
tion role in shifting the center of
power in the party from eastern pro-
gressives to western conservatives.
    He brought the GOP back from
the verge of extinction in the mid-
1960s and then plunged it into crisis
