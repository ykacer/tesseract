 Health care
 Higher taxes
 seen as a must
 for reform
 From Journal wire reports

     Boston, Mass. ~ It will take
 higher taxes affecting virtually
 every American to raise the tens
 of billions of dollars a year need-
 ed to pay for universal health
 coverage, Rep. Dan Rostenkow-
 ski says.
    The Illinois Democrat, chair-
man of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee,
said Friday that additional mon-
ey was needed because he doubt-
ed the administration's estimates
about cost savings.
    But he said he did not want to
pursue some new levy like a
value-added tax. Rather, he said
he preferred expanding "a tax
that is already on the books."
    He would not say whether he
wanted to raise income tax rates,
or to rely on any other specific
approach, noting he first would
make his proposal to his com-
mittee when it takes up the issue,
probably the week after next. In
the past, he also has advocated
much higher gasoline taxes.
    Rostenkowski's proposal goes
against the Clinton administra-
tion's fear that opposition by Re-
publicans and some Democrats
would doom health care legisla-
tion if any significant tax in-
creases are sought to finance it.
    But he said, "I think this is a
major program, and if we are
serious, we have to belly up to
the barf

EMPLOYEE MANDATES
    Rostenkowski defended the
idea of making employers help
pay for their workers' insurance,
although he promised to "do
what we can to moderate the
impact on smaller employers."
    "They may temporarily l~el
some pain, but they will adjust,
survive and thrive," he said.
    Rostenkowski said he liked
the plan adopted by a Ways and
Means health subcommittee last
month to expand Medicare to
cover the poor, the unemployed
and the underemployed.
    He also praised that bill's
cost-containment mechanism for
both the public and private sec-
tors. That bill, fashioned by Rep.
Fortney Pete Stark (D-Calif.),
would raise the cigarette tax by
$1.25 a pack.
