 The best
 fashion buys
 from
  discount stores

THOSE SNOOTY COUTURE
wardrobes that cost a zillion
dollars are yesterday's news.
These days it's pretty clear
the smartest fashion choices
around are those that
combine great looks with a reasonable
price tag. (Why else would all the
biggest fashion houses be falling all
over themselves to create lower-priced
lines?) Now it's possible to hit the
discount stores, armed with a sense of
style and a skinny wallet, and still
come away with terrific outfits. Our
fashion editors visited some national
stores and found a closetful of great-
looking (and affordable) clothes.
Here are some of the prettiest looks
for work and for play.
