             workings are the Victory tungsten
             mine. Rocks are Triassic(?) volcanic
             rocks and Triassic and Jurassic sedi-
             mentary rocks Intruded by a group of
             Cretaceous plutons ranging from gran-
             odlorlte to granite, Tungsten and
             lead-sliver deposits occur In the
             con?ac? aureoles of the plutons.
             Beyond the Lodl Hills is the Paradise
             Range.

32.1         1.7 Gebbs. Processing plant of Basic,
                     inc. for megnesite-bruclte ores.
                     Much of the magneslte is used to
                     produce refectory products for
                     furnaces. The magneslte and bruclte
                     occur In dolomite of the Triassic
                     Lunlng Formation, In the mineralized
                     area, dark fine-grained dolomite has
                     been marmorlzed to a lighter colored,
                     coarser-grained massive dolomite that
                     Is Intergrown In varying proportions
                     with magnesite. A great variety of
                     dikes as well as a stock of grano-
                     diorite Intrude the Lunlng Formation
                     In the vicinity of the deposit. The
                     magneslte (and recrystalllzed dolo-
                     mite) Is believed to have formed by
                     the hydrothermal replacement of
                     regionally metamorphosed sedimentary
                     dolomite (Schilling, 1968).

              and Triassic and Jurassic carbonate
              and clastlc rocks Intruded by a group
              of Cretaceous plutons and overlain by

                      Miocene slllclc Ignlmbrltes                                     and

           The Falrplay mining district Is lo-
       cated about 8 miles to the southeast.
       Most of the mines In the Falrplay
       district are associated with epl-

        thermal precious metal deposits In

        Tertiary volcanic rocks.

        Also,    scheellte-bearlng    tsctlte
        occurs adjacent to a granitic pluton.
        in 1978, UV Industrlesannounced the
        discovery In this district of 28
        million tons of rock containing 0.25~
        molybdenlte with values In silver and
        copper.

             on the left (east), Mercury occurs
             In Tertiary Intermediate volcanlcs.
             The mineralization is associated with
             siilclficatlon, argllllzatlon, and
             native sulfur, and is similar to the
             gold mineralization at the Paradise
             Peak deposit. The first rock-chip
             sample was taken at the Rex mercury
             occurrence, and led to FMCts dis-
             covery of the Paradise Peak orebody.

        Mining Group Inc. The deposit has 24
        million tons of ore of current mine-
        able reserves which average .045 oz/T
        Au and .47 oz/T Ag, The ore is amen-
        able to heap-leech processing and
        mining will be an open pit operation.
