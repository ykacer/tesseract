FOR. SPEED

    The greasy mechanic in the was-
white T-shirt has been replaced with
a highly trained technician who spe-
cializes in one aspect of the car's op-
eration and gets paid a fat 5-figure
salary with retirement benefits. Add
a zero for crew chiefs with the tuning
skills of Austin Coil, who calls the
shots on the Castrol GTX Oldsmobile
Funny Car driven by 2-time Winston
Funny Car-champ John Force.
    At national events, the quickest 18
qualifiers in each class race tourna-

merit style. The losers go home. The
winners get back to the pits and pre-
pare their car for the next round.

Top Fuel
The rear-engine Top Fuel dragster
was invented in 1970, by "Big Daddy"
Don Garlits, the most famous drag
racer of all time, after a transmission
explosion in his front-engine machine
stole half his right foot. Today's
"diggers" still follow this design,
weigh a minimum of 1950 pounds and

have a maximum wheelbase of 300
in. Power comes from supercharged
fuel-injected 5000-horsepower alu-
minum aftermarket engines, based
on Chrysler's hemispherical (Hemi)
combustion-chamber design used in
passenger cars in the '50s and '60s.

Level of sophistication Includes Iclockwise
from bottom leftJ clutch timing system,
offset front ends, purpose-built aluminum
supercharged nitromethane-fueled 500 cid
engines and complicated on-board com-
puters to monitor ail of the car's functions.
