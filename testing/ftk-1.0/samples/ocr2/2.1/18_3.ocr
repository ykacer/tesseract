 to sit in on some
 photos when she took
 her toddler for
 portraits in 1991.
After confronting her
image on film, she had
the photographer

and was inspired to
join Weight Watchers.

MAKEUP PALETTE
To emphasize Sue's blue eyes, makeup artist Sarah Bandy began by
accentuating her brows, which were thin and uneven. Using quick, short
strokes, she filled in both brows with light brown and blonde pencils. An
amethyst-tone pencil outlined upper lashes before a coat of black mascara
was applied. A soft brown-gray powder shadow downplayed the fullness

of her upper lids. To play up the warmth of
Sue's coloring, Sarah applied a sheer rose blush
and azalea-tone lipstick.

SUBTLE
HIGHLIGHTS
Colorist Marina Chausinio began by using a
rinse two shades lighter than Sue's natural
blonde hair to create a

brighter base tone.
Highlights were added

 to bring out the warm honey tones and to add
 movement to Sue's shorter new style.

HAIRSTYLING
Since Sue hadn't had her hair cut in over four
years, stylist George Breck had plenty to work

with. He trimmed "two-
years'-worth" (several

inches) off the bottom, bringing the sides up to
expose cheekbones. The new, shorter length is
in better proportion with Sue's petite stature. In
addition, it called attention to her neckline and
gave the hair more body, increased movement
and greater reflection of light.
