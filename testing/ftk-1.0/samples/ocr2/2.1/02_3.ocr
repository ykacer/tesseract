6.2.2 DesiKn of MitiKatinK Features

6.2.2.1 Introduction

        Neither the identification nor the analyses of the DBAs needed to
identify mitigating features has been completed. Identification of an
initial set of mitigating features is scheduled for the ACD. This section
discusses the methods planned for identifying and establishing the design
requirements of features needed to prevent or mitigate releases to the
accessible environment.

6.2.2.2 Methods for IdentifyinK Mitigating Features

        The process envisioned to determine the design features necessary
for the prevention or mitigation of offsite releases is summarized in
Figure 6-3. The objective is to identify, by performing analyses of all
