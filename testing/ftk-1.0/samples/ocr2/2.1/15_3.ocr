I                         CHAIRMAN PALLADINO: Thank you.
2                         Well, let ms ask one question either or both of
3       you can comment on.
4                         If I understand DOE's position, it is that the
5       purpose of the preliminary determination was to assure all
6       parties that they were going after sites that really had
7       the potential for being suitable, baaed on the availability
8       of information.
V                         Now, if one waits until after characterization,
l0      then is this a preliminary decision? I admit it is a more

16      ultimate decisions by the Commission on licensing as to the
17      suitability of the site.
Is                        Even the Commission's licensing decisions are
19      going to be preliminary in this program because we won't
20      know for a long time whether these sites are really
2]      suitable.
22                        Making the determination prior to characterization
23      iS SO preliminary as to be meaningless. They are making
2J      that determination in selecting the sites to characterize.
25      It doesn't add anything to that to say, "We preliminarily
