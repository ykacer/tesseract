Comeents that appea? nearly Identical for the different sites reflect
information that was presented tn the final EA's that wis ve~s simtlar among
sites. Similar comments do, however, take into consideration differences
resulting from slte-spectfic information.

CGNCLUSI0~S AI~L) RECOMIq£NOATIONS

It is apparent that significant efforts were made by DOE to respond to the NRC
staff major toe,cents on the draft EA's, and In fact many of these colnents have
been resolveG, however, for each of the final EA's our review identified
remaining concerns many of which are the same type of concerns identified in
our review of the draft EA's such as X) not identifying the range of
uncertainties associated with the existtno limited data base, 2) not
identifying the range of alternative interpretations and assumptions that can
be reasonably su~;orted by existing dice, and 3) hot incorl~rattng i reisonable
range cf uncertainties and alternative interpretations tnto evaluations and
conclusions. Based on the above w believe Chat some conclusions in the final
E,~'s are stii~ (:verly favorable or optimistic for the areis of cc~nt.

In accordancP v/iCh our review plan, the NRC staff also reviewed aspects of the
Met~odolooy Document. As mentioned earlier the NRC staff ~td not evalulte the
ranking of the sites or the ranking methodolo~..v itself. Just as was done for
:he draft E~'s, the review focused on the existing data and how that data wes
used in the evaluations in the final EA's aK the Methodology Oocumn=. From
this review it was clear that evaluations and conclusions resardtng site
conGi~ions ~resenteo in the final EA's were factored into ~ evalulttons of
scenGrios and their consequer, ces presented in the ~.:ethodolog.y Gocumnt.
Therefore, conclusions on repcsitory performance in the Methodology Document
that ~ere derive¢ from evaluations and conclusions in the final EA's, that are
cunsiGered in our commmJ)tS co be overly optimistic, are likewise considered to
be overly optimistic. Some examples for the Hinford Site are ~) insufficient
ccP. siderat!cn of flow along la~e, discrete fau!t$ and fracture zones that may
exist within dense flow interiorS, including consideration of fracture flow as
~n "unexpected' 'eature rather thin an "expected' one, and ~) inadequate
consideration of a]ternattve assumptions retarding pumping for the ~r~ll-scale
exploratory dr!l ling scenario. Some factorS which were not given tufficient
corsideration for the salt sites are 1~ effects of host rock mass
heterogeneittet and 2) shaft and repo.eitory sealing concerns related to
:herr~!ly inducted salt creep and differential uplift. An example from the
Yucca J',:ountair Site ts the !ack of consideration that hydrothermal activity
could be a future sourr e of fluid important to v:~ste oackage corrosion. For
:l' sites, tPe effects of alternative corrosion r. echantsms war-. ,not factored
into waste ~ackage lifetime anal:,ses. Finally, considering the exam]es noted
abcv¢, i~ is overly optimistic to state on p. ~-41 of the MethOGOlOg.Y 0ocumert
that %,hen place¢ cna scale where a zero c~n be interpreted as per'or~.ence at
the minimum leve~ -equated b) the pri,m, arj'-contair, ment reoui~erents of the EPA
stanc~ds and '.CC is perfection, all of t.qe sites have expected utilities of
c9.7 cr higher."
