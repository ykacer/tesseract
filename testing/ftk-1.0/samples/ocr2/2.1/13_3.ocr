        Pinyon-Juniper woodland is not repre·ented in the southern Argus
 Nounr~tins or Slice P. ange; but this zone is represented ·bore 6,500 or
 ?,00O feet in the Panamint Nountains, ·oM 20 miles northeast of Seerles
 Lake and in the northern Argus Nountains 20 miles northwest of Singles
 Lake. Aeaocilted L'ith this zone are mount·in mahogany (Cercotarpus),

           NODER~ POLLI~ RAIK AT SEAR.ES

         In 196~, a series of modern pollen traps were placed in ·n east-nest
 transect ocro·s the ·ouch iud of Se, trles Lake basin along an abandoned
 trockviy (see C. I. Smith, fig. 2). The traps are standard rain [ages
 equipped rich filters of 10-micron Msh ·et in the funnel of the sages.
 The instruments vere set up in October vhen lev plants vere blessing, and
 the~ pollen filters yore collected in 196~, eeaccly f year liter. Samples
 thus obtained are assumed to represent aerial pollen rain for I vhlle
 year's interval. 7rap samples vere analyzed for relative compos~'~ Ind
 for total sUnSets of pollen grains trapped per square centloecer per year.
 Soil samples frmt each site yore analyzed for contained pollen. The
 purpose of this trlniect vas to determine the absolute number and compo-
 sition of the n~dern pollen rain at both basin and mount, aim sites, ·nd to
 compare airborne pollen rain vith pollen in local modern ·oils, end with
 the sub·urface pollen stratigraphy.

        The results of this study are summrized in fiFure 1. Absolute
 numbers ©f pollen per square c2~/yr ranged from about 200 to 1,200. The
 higher fallout occurred on the divides (·e· bottom of fig. 1). The most
 common pollen t~pos found in the pollen trips for the year 1963-196~
 vere found to represent groups tJdt gray in Searles Valley. Pollen types
 probably frc~ local plants include:

   Chunopodiaceae, ·altbush family: 10-30 percent of the counts rich
the higher percentaoes occurring on the fans vhere members of this family
are best represented. !~mbirs of chi· famil7 cannot be assigned to genus,
except for grass·rood (Sircobltus) (a Fare pollen type graving in Death
Valley), ·nd hence one cannot say vhich local genera of Chenopodiaceae ·re
represented. ~eit representation of Chermpodieceae pollen both in absoluta
numbers per square centimeters per year and in percentages of the counts
is in the bn areas vhere members of this family dominate the yes·titian.

        Compolitae, daisy family: between 10 and 32 percent of counts. The
Franseria pollen type, vhich can be recognized by its long spines, is best
repros·scad on L'be ridgetopi vhere this plant is most abundant. Percentages
of ·hortolpined Coupositae ore about the ammo across the transect. Absolute
nmabers of Composit~e pollen are greatest on the rids·topi, in part doe to
· higher representation of Franseria pollen fallout, but also because total
fallout b'aa greatest there. Artemi·la-(ease) of this family is excluded
frc~ the Composite· counts in figure ! and is discussed later.
