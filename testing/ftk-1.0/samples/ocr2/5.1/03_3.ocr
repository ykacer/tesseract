          perature survey of a desert vegetation mosaic. Ecology 44:821-824.

      From March 4 to May g, lg60 soil temperature and moisture mea-
      surements were made in 7 plant habitats on the Nevada Test Site,
      Nye County, Nevada. Soil moisture was determined by gravimetric
      sampling, and temperatures were measured using the sucrose inver-
      sion technique. Cooler soil temperatures were not always associ-
      ated with an increase in elevation. In some cases topographic
      positions and soil properties influenced soil temperatures and
      available soil moisture more strongly than did elevational changes.

         plant recolonization of a nuclear target area. Radiation Botany 3:
         41-44.

      Vegetational analyses were conducted three years post-detonation
      in a nuclear target area in a Grayia spinosa-Lyoi~ ~ersonii
      community in Yucca Flat, Nevada. Annual plants dominated the
      early stage of recolonization and were quantitatively more abun-
      dant in the disturbed areas than in an adjacent undisturbed shrub
      community. Mentzelia albicaulis and Chaenactis stevioides
      occurred in both disturbed and undisturbed areas; however, Men~zelia
      was more abundant in disturbed areas while Chaenacti8 was more
      abundant in the undisturbed community. $aZsola kaZi was confined
      to disturbed areas while Phacelia vallismortae was more often en-
      countered in the undisturbed community. The plant recolonization
      of a mechanically disturbed area was quantitatively and qualitative-
      ly more like that of the interior zone of the nuclear target area
      than less disturbed habitats. These data support a conclusion
      that soil displacement presents a more rigorous habitat for plant
      recolonization than disturbances created by the wider ranging de-
      structive components of a nuclear detonation. (Auth)

     The potential benefits to be derived for mankind from continued
     development of peaceful applications for plutonium cannot be
     denied. The technology of plutonium production and processing
     is already established, but the realization of its peaceful appli-
     cations depends largely upon the development of methods for pre-
     venting its distribution in the environment. Because of safe-
     guards and effective control measures, no accidental plutonium con-
     tamination of the public domain has imposed serious risks to a
     population group. Trace amounts of plutonium from above-ground
