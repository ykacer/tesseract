buyin  a Used car doesn't
ave t'o be a drag
by m.f. thompson

After someone swiped her Saab from a New York City
street, Anne Howard scanned the classified ads for something
good, cheap and used to replace it. Three days later, she bought a
1982 Volkswagen Rabbit. "It had a little rust," she recalls, "and the
engine didn't sound terrific, but it was cheap and drivable." For a few
hours, at least. The morning after registering her car, Howard set
out on a 200-mile drive. When she stopped for coffee, the Rabbit
stopped for good. And she was hundreds of dollars in the hole.
    The thought of buying yet another car filled her with dread. She's
not alone. Recent research by auto-industry consultant J.D. Power
and Associates shows that women prefer having their teeth drilled
to shopping for a car.
    It doesn't have to be that way. Buying a used car is always a
gamble, but knowing the rules of the game can help stack the
odds in your favor. Rule one: Take time to shop around. Rule two:

Take even more time if you're shopping from pri-
vate car owners. As Howard found, you may get
a better price than you'd find at a dealership, but
you'll be buying the car with no written warranty
and no servicing center.
    Car dealers, on the other hand, are required by
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to put war-
ranty information on the windows of their cars. A

few states require dealers to provide warranties, but
most don't (the phrase "as is" usually means there's no
warranty at all).
    New-car dealers who take trade-ins can be a good
source of well-maintained, late-model used cars with
limited warranties-and hefty price tags. Theygenerally
keep the best of their trade-in cars, auctioning off the
more battered bumpers to used-car dealers. You'll find
lower prices at those used-car lots, but beware: They're
also rest homes for world-weary police cars and taxi
cabs (not necessarily identified as such). Whether

you're shopping new- or used-car lots, Iool~ for well-established
dealers with reputations to protect.
    But before you hit the streets, do some homework. Check your
local library for Consumer Reports magazine's latest April issue,
devoted completely to cars. Its "frequency of repair" data on various
makes and models can steer you clear of clunkers. To determine
the fair market value of a car, check the National Automobile Deal-
ers Association (NADA) Official Used Car Guide, also known as "the
blue book," available in the reference section of most libraries and in
some banks. Some affiliate clubs of the American Automobile Asso-
ciation will also quote members the price over the phone.
    Once you've narrowed down your options, choose a clear day and
close friend for your car hunt. You'll need both to look for nicks and
listen for knocks. Some red lights to watch for:
ELECTRICAL BREAK~WN Test all the switches by having your friend
stand outside to confirm that signals and lights are working proper-
ly. Electrical problems can mean costly repair work.
HOLES IN THE DASHBOARD These could be a sign you're in an old cab or
police car that had equipment mounted on the dash. (Bullet holes
are another telltale sign.) A tough past may preclude a long future.
RAMPANT RUST Wheel wells, rocker panels (under doors) and door
edges are most vulnerable to damage. Look for flaking paint, often a
sign of underlying rust. A little shouldn't concern you, but if rust has
eaten through the trunk or interior floor, lethal fumes can enter the car.
BLUE SMOKE Take the car out for a test drive, get it up to highway
speed, then take your foot off the accelerator for a few seconds. If
you spot blue smoke billowing from the exhaust, the car is burning
oil. Major engine repairs ahead.
BENT BODY Drive through a puddle, then check the tire tracks left by
the wet wheels (or ask a friend to watch from behind). The rear tires
should directly follow the tracks of the front tires. If they don't, the
body or frame has been bent. Don't buy it.    '
LYING MILES It's illegal to tamper with odometers. Even so, it's esti-
mated that mileage counters are rolled back on more than half of
the used cars sold every year. There's no surefire way to spot

tampering, but a few things should raise suspi-

cion. If the odometer reads fewer than 25,000
miles, the car should have all of its original
tires. They shouldn't be bald (or brand-new).
Ditto for the rubber pedal pads on the brakes
and the accelerator.
 IS THAT A BANANA IN YOUR TAILPIPE, OR ARE YOU JUST
 HAPPY TO SEE ME? An ex-used-car salesman

shared his old stick-a-banana-peel-up-a-tailpipe trick
with us. The peel apparently muffles troubled exhaust
systems long enough to make a sale. Finding a
banana anywhere in the engine probably doesn't
bode well for the integrity of the seller or the quality
of the car. Keep hunting.
     If the car passes these tests, take it to a mechanic
 you trust for a final inspection. Needs Work? Ask the
 mechanic for an estimated cost of repairs, then use
 it to haggle down the car's price. []
