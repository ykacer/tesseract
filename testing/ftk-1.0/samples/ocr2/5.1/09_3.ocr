  Surprising salads with
potatoes (oven-fried) and
  squash (scooped out)

To a Westerner, salads are many things
served many ways. They frequently har-
bor unexpected and refreshing combina-
tions of ingredients. Here, we present two
such surprising recipes.
The first takes a new look at potato salad.
Instead of boiling, you slice the potatoes,
oven-fry them to a golden brown color,
then serve them warm or at room temper-
ature with a light dressing of balsamic
vinegar, parsley, and green onion.

The second salad is a colorful mix of two
tender squash: green zucchini and yellow
crookneck. You cook them whole to get a
pleasantly firm texture, scoop out the
seedy centers, and slice to create decora-
tive half-moon shapes.
Serve the salads together, perhaps with
cheese and bread for a simple meal; or
offer them separately, when your menu
calls for potatoes or squash. Both salads
use an unusually small amount of oil.

Oven-fried Potato Salad
11/2 pounds small (about 11/2-in.-
     diameter) red thin-skinned
     potatoes
   About 2 tablespoons olive oil or
    salad oil
 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion
 3 tablespoons minced parsley
 1/4 teaspoon pepper
   Salt
Scrub potatoes and cut into Vs-inch-thick
slices (to brown evenly, slices must be
uniformly thick); discard the ends of the
potatoes.
Brush 2 baking pans, each 10 by 15 inch-
es, with oil. Arrange slices in a single
layer; lightly brush tops of potatoes with
more oil. Bake in a 450° oven until both
sides are deep, golden brown, about 25
minutes. Check frequently after 10 min-
utes for even browning; turn over slices
that are not cooking evenly, or move to a
cooler or hotter area of pan, as needed.
As slices are browned, transfer with a
wide spatula to a serving bowl. (If made
ahead, let stand, uncovered, up to 3
hours.) To potatoes, add vinegar, onion,
parsley, and pepper; mix gently. Add salt
to taste. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

Green and Yellow Squash Salad
11/2 pounds each zucchini (about 11/2-in.
     diameter) and yellow crookneck
     squash (about 2-in. diameter in
     thickest part), rinsed
     1/2 cup minced red onion
     1/4 cup lemon juice
 2 tablespoons minced fresh or 2
    teaspoons dry basil leaves
 I tablespoon minced fresh or 1
    teaspoon dry oregano leaves
 I tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or
    salad oil
In a 6- to 8-quart pan, bring 3 quarts
water to a boil over high heat. Add zuc-
chini and crookneck; simmer, uncovered,
until just tender when pierced, about 8
minutes. Drain; immerse squash in ice
water just until cold; drain. If made
ahead, cover and chill up until next day.
Trim off squash ends; discard. Cut squash
in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scrape
out and discard seeds. Cut halves cross-
wise into 3/s-inch-thick slices.
In a bowl, combine onion, lemon juice,
basil, oregano, and oil. Add squash and
mix gently. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
