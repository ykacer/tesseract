    SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Jimmy Delgado
got his gang tattoos to tell the world
who he was. He wants to gel rid of
th..qm because of who he wants to be.
    'the distinctive marks turn off pro-
spective employers, threatening the
life he plans away from the street.
    "I stopped trying to look for a job."
Delgado said. "Even if I'm dressed
nice.., they don't want to hear what
I have to say."
    The 17-year-old former member of
the Palmas gang doesn't plan on hav-
ing the palm-tree tattoo on his neck
much longer.
    He is among about 100 youths ex-
pected to take advantage of a new city
program under which a plastic sur-
geon will remove gang tatloos for free.
    "A gang tattoo not only says some-
thing about your past, il can rob you
of your dreams for tomorrow and
can damage a young person's sell
image," Mayor Susan Hammer said
recently in announcing the program.
     Removing tattoos by surgery or by
 laser can cost several thousand dol-
 lars. But Dr. Josh Korman, who has
 traveled to poor countries lo repair
 cleft palates and do other reconstruc-
 tive surgery, is donating his services.
     "I think this will give people an
 opportunity to get back into llle
 workforce," he said.
     The trealment will be at Foresl
 Surgery Center, which is waiving
 most of its fee. The city is contribut-
 ing $15,000 m cover some of the ex-
 penses and the rental of a laser.
     John Lawrence, 18, plans to take
 advantage of the offer. Lawrence, a
 former gang member, is back in
 school, working toward his high
 school equivalency diploma, and
 wants to learn various trades.
     tie plans to cover up the tattoos on
 his arms. But he wants to remove a
 large "Good Times Bad Times" tattoo
 on his neck, a group of dots on his
 cheek and "Turtle" -- his old gang
 name -- from above his left eyebrow.
     "When you put on a tattoo, you're
 advertising who you are and where
 you're from," he said.
    At first, he said, "it's fun .... You
don't see all the bad paris. I just got
-tired, man. You can't be looking be-
hind your back forever."
