    VINTAGE
DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY L.M. Kit Car-
son (1967, Fox Lorber, un?'ated,
$79.95) Years before he went Hol-
lywood with The Big Easy and
Great Balls of Fire!, director Jim
McBride scored with this droll put-
on, a fake underground movie that
shoots snarky darts through film-
student pretensions. David Holz-
man (Carson) is a sincere young
twerp who, seeking Big Truth,
films his life in what was the then-
fashionable grainy B&W v~rit~.
What he finds is a swift corrective
to all those who think movies are
more important than reality. Raw,
ragged, and fight, D/avy is both an
unerring late-'60s time capsule and
as modern as teen angst. A- --TB

 DOCUMENTARY

THE LOST FLEET OF GUADALCANAL
(1993, Columbia TriStar, $19.95)
When Robert Ballard, who discov-
ered the Titanic and the Bismarck,
set off in 1992 to find 50 "ghost
ships" downed in the World War II
battle of Guadalcanal, he met with
only modest success. Fortunate-
ly, he'd brought reinforcements:
American and Japanese survivors
of the harrowing six-month fight.
Their moving reminiscences 50
years later, accompanied by vivid
archival footage, far eclipse Bal-
lard's underwater video of sunken
metal. Combining elements of the
Jacques Cousteau and war-docu-
mentary genres, National Geo-
graphic's Lost Fleet ultimately tran-
scends both. A --Susan Chumsky

     MUSIC
PRIDE AND JOY: THE STORY OF ALLIGA-
TOR RECORDS Koko Taylor, Lonnie
Brooks (1993, BMG, $29.95) For
more than two decades, Alligator
Records has been introducing
young, mostly white music fans to
contemporary hard blues. The la-
bel's success story--captured in
this 87-minute documentary--in-
volves equal parts nostalgia, clever
marketing, and a genuine labor of
love. Director Robert Mugge (Deep
Blues) places Alligator in the con-
text of the Chicago blues scene, in-
terviews key players, and presents
some enthralling live performances.
But the tape still suffers from the
perfunctory: In band interviews,
Alligator artists reveal a good-na-
tured sincerity without ever dig-
ging deeper than Tayior's remark,
"We ate it. We slept it. We was born
with the blues." C+ --Taehee Klm

        'CRYING' TIME
WITH ARTSIER video renters having
run through Howards End (which drops
off the top 10 this week), The Crying
Game finally joins the chart at No. 7 in
its third week in release. Apparently,
laserdisc buyers were awaiting the Oscar
nominee far more eagerly than tape
renters: The laser version debuts at a sur-
prising No. 2.

    Meanwhile, the upward mobility of Columbia qYiStar/
Voyager's laserdisc of Bram Stoker's Dracula may soon
be halted. Two just-released inexpensive, wide-screen
versions should cut into the sales of the current pricey
($124.99), feature-packed edition.
