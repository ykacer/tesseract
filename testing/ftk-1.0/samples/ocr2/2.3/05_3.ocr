XX                                                ABSTRACT OF VOLUME.

 CHAPTER VI: HISTORY OF BONNEVILLE BAsIN.--Previous to the Bonneville history the basin was
     arid. The first rise of the lake was without overflow, and was long maintained; Ihe Yellow Clay
     was then deposited. The second rise went 90 feet higher, causing overflow, but was of shorter
     duration; the White Marl was then deposited. The final drying divided the basin into a dozen
     independent basins, the largest of which contains Great Salt Lake. Since 1845 that lake has
     repeatedly risen and fallen through a range of 10 feet.--The history of Lake Bonneville is par-
     alleled by that of Lake Lahontan, and each is connected with a history of glaciation in adjacent
     mountains. This connection, the depauperation of the fossil shells, and an analysis of the climatic
     conditions of glaciation, lead to the conclusion that the lacustrine epochs were epochs of relative
     cold.
CHAPTER VII: LAKE BONNEVILLEAND VOLCANIC ERUPTION.--The group of small craters and basaltic
    lava fields near Fillmore, Utah, are closely related to the lake history. Some eruptions took place
    beneath the water of tile lake, others since its disappearance, and others ,qgain during the inter-
    lacustrine epoch.--Numerous basaltic eruptions occurred in the lake area before the lake period,
    and at still earlier dates rhyolite was extravasated.
CItAPTER VIII: LAKE BONNEVILLE AND DIASTROPHISM.--Orogonic change during a period subsequent
    to the lake is shown by fault scarps. The formation of fault scarps is accompanied by earth-
    quakes.--Epeirogenic change during a period subsequent to the lake is shown I,y the deformation
    of the planes of the shore-lines. Under tile postulate that the doming of the planes is due to the
    drying away of the lake, it is conclu~ that the strains induced by lbo unloading of tile areas
    exceeded the e!astic limit of the material and caused viscous distortion of the earth's crust.
    This result, taken in connection with the phenomena of mountain uplift, leads to an estimat~ of
    the strength of the crust.
C~.APTEz' IX: AGE OF THE EQUU8 FAUNA.--The Equus fauna at its type locality is contained in lake
    beds correlated by physical relations with the uppermost of the Lahontan and Bonneville beds,
    The fauna, previously called later Pliocene~ is thus shown to have lived in late Pleistocene time.
