Off on a joint publicity tour, writer spouses Jim and Kate Lehrer have found...
A NOVEL APPROACH TO LOVE

A "1 tend to be a more interior writer, and Jim's style is more direct, more muscular," says Kate (relaxing in Jim's study, the "bus room").

T TVAS THE PRI.XTEI) T~ORI), IN A SENSE,
that brought Jim and Kate Lehrer
together. When they first met, in
1959, he was a young reporter with
the Dallas Morning News, and she
had just arrived in town to start work
as a junior-high English teacher. As
Kate recalls, "I was moving into my
apartment house, and Jim [her new
neighbor] offered to carry my books
up the stairs." Nine months later, he
carried her across the threshold.
 Today, books continue to be the

ties that bind. In May, Jim, 59, and
Kate, 53, embarked on a nine-city
tour to promote his seventh novel,
Blue Hearts, a caper about an aging
spy, and her second, When They
Took Away the Man in the Moon, a
tender story of family life in Texas.
(Both have received glowing re-
views.) After a four-week hiatus, the
tour resumes this week for a five-city
jaunt that also will boost Jim's folksy
1992 memoir, A Bus of My Own,
coming out this month in paperback.

    Jim, better known as the Washing-
ton-based half of PBS's Emmy-win-
ning MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, is
an old hand at this sort of barnstorm-
ing and all too familiar with its lone-
lier aspects. But last winter, inspira-
tion struck. "I felt, 'My goodness,
ill could work out a deal where Kate
goes with me, 1'11 have my cake and
eat it too,' "says Jim, at home with
Kate in their five-bedroom gray stuc-
co home in Washington's comfort-
able Cleveland Park neighborhood.
