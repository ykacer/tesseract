135' West Longitude. A second data set of just the NTS area for the
time period 1969-1972 was obtained from U.S.G.S. This set contained
seismic events detected and located using stations of the U.S.G.S.,

Sandia Laboratories, Incorporated, and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory local
seismograph networks. A third data set was obtained frcxn the U.S.~;.S.
which covered a section of central California along the San Andreas Fault
where they employ a dense network of seismograph $tation~.

         Perspective plot~ of the earthquake ~train release for the California/
Nevada area were prepared for one-year periods between 1950 and ]973 and
for ten-year periods ]933-1942 through 1963-1972. These plots represent
the cumulative strain release for each of 1,760 1/4' by 1/4' grid units
between 32.5' nd 42.5' North Latitude and 113.5° and 124.5' West Longi-
tude. In an earlier report (Willis and others, 1973), szmilar plots were
published for the Nevada area extending back to 2852. Trend~ of ear~%~uake
activity are clearly visible on these perspective plot~ but no pattern of
migration could be detected in the seismic activity. ~ior could short term
increases or changes in seismic activity be detected beyond the NTS area
that would correlate with the MrS testing progr&m.

          Cross-correlation of the 1956 strain release data (a year which
 contained no significant underground nuclear tests) with the strain
 release data for each year between 1950 and 197] indicated a reoccurrence
 every 5 to 6 years of high maximum correlation coefficients. This may
 be due to the reoccurrenc~ of one or more major earthquakes in the same
 grid unit. As with the visual analysis, no corre]ations were observed
 with the NTS ~ctivity.
