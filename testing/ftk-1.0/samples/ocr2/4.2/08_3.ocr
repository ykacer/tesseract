                 4000'

07-31-81         Ran Birdwell NCTL log to 1750'. Ran compensated density and gamma
                 ray logs to T.D. of 3994'    Ran epithermal neutron to T.D. of
                 3gg3', no log. Ran fluid density log, checked fluid level at
                 1546' Ran perforation gun and perforated casing from 1644' to
                 1572' with 2 shots per foot.

08-01-81         Completed perforating casing from 1572' to 1564'. Ran Simplec
                 televiewer to T.D. at 3987'. Ran Birdwell compensated density and
                 gamma ray logs to T.D. at 3ggo'. Ran Birdwell epithermal neutron
