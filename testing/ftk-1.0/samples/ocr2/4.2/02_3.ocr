PRINCIPLES OF GEOST.4TISTICS

· us assume that lengths It, 12" .l,~ are all superior to tl. 'File estimation
 variance is ot)tained by weighting the extension wwiance of each drift within
 its influence panel l)v lhe square of the surface of this panel:

    Tile explored mineralized surface being S = ti (It + 1.2 ''' '+' l,~) and tile
total develol)ed length being L = It 4- l~ 4- "' I,, we obtain the following
remarkable formula:                   _ c

    Once the estimation variance has been calculated, one has still to in-
terpret it for practical uses under the form of convcnlt'onal error spread.
This aim is reached l)y allocating to this variance a probal)ilistic meaning.
By implicit reference to a gaussian model, we shall take it that the actual
average grade of the deposit is included within a 95% probability in the
range m :k 2a, m being the estimated grade. In other cases, particularly if
2v is not small towards m, we shall take the si)read m exp (4-2a~ mY, by
reference to a lognormal model.
     These implicit references to probabilistic models are mainly arbitrary.
 Actually', the notion itself of statistical distril)ution of an estimation error
 is doubtlessly meaningless. The only thing which has an objective physical
 meaning is the variance. This is why we sl)eak about conventional spreads.
 Their l)ractical interest resides in the fact that they' draw a more intuitive
 picture of the possible errors than variances themselves.

                    KRIGING
     A second application of major importance is t)rovided by a geostatistical
 procedure called "kriging." It consists in estimating the grade of a panel by
 computing the weighted average of available saint)les, some being located
 inside others outside the panel. The grads of these samples being x~,
 x2, ''' x,, we attempt to evaluate the unknown .~rade z of the panel with
 a linear estimator z* of the forxn:

    The suitable weights a; assigned to each sample are determined by' two
conditions. The first one expresses that z* anti z must have the same aver-
age value within the whole large field l? and is written as:

    The second condition expresses that the a~ have such values that estima-
tion variance of z by z*. in other words the kriging variance, should take the
smallest possil)le value.
