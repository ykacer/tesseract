         Realistic temperature dependent nonlinear .~aterial properties have been
         incorporated in the program and the solution at each point in t~)~e ~s
         obtained by iteration.

2, Each element has a "birth" and "death" time. Therefore, stresses at
   different stages of excavation or construction can be obtained.

        The substructure (or super element~ option allows areas of the mesh
        representing the surrounding rock mass that are tar removed fr~:l the
        high stress regions to be modeled by elastic substructures in whlch
        all the unknowns are eliminated within these substructures. AS a
        result, only a limited number of elements are required in the iterative
        nonlinear analysis ~See Figure di.

4.      6eometric constraints have been added to the program which allow coarse and
        fine meshes to be merged without the use of trxangular e)e~,~ents. Therefore,
        a consistently higher level of accuracy is obtained ,see Figure ~.

       Prior to the temnination of this study, work nad begun on the development of
a three-dimensiona) element i4 to 27 nodes~ with temperature oepenaent, nonlinear
properties. This effort is about half coe~pleted, and work was also ~nitlated on
the development of a general three-dimensional mesh generation progrd~;) for
underground Structures with openings of arbitrary geometric shape.

        It has been demonstrated that USAP is not only an effective program for
the correlation studies associated with the Stripa project, but has tne potential
to De used effectively in far more general problems associated with the under-
ground storage of nuclear waste. The options of temperature-dependent nonl~nedr
