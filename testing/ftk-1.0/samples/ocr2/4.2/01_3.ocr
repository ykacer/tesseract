 lcd baby. who may need vitamin D. Be-
 cause sunlight is a major source of vita-
 mia D, and skin pigmentation can affect
 thc absorption of this nutrient, breast-
 fed babies born in cold climates or to
 African-American mothers may also re-
 quire vitamin D supplements.

 Q. My children don't like meat. Are
 they missing important nutrients by
 leaving it on their plates?
 A. Not if they eat other foods that pro-
 vide what meal offers. From dairy prod-
 ucts they get protein. Vegetables and
 fruit provide vitamins and other essen-
 tials. Most children eat poultry and
 some like fish, both good sources of
 iron. If your children are excluding till
 meat, poultry, and fish, consult ti pedia-
 trician or qualified nutritionist to make
 sure their diets meet essential needs.

 Q. My son's nine-year-old friend is
 never allowed sweets in his own home.
 When he visits us, he helps himself to
 cookies and can easily consume several
 bowls of sweetened breakfast cereal in a
 short time. Is his family's no-sweets rule
 making him a "closet sweet eater?"
A. Yes. Whenever certain foods are for-
bidden by parents, but are still available
to children, children will find ways to eat
them. Your son's friend has found a
black market to satisfy his sweet tooth.
And these foods are even more tasty be-
cause they are being eaten on the sly.
This is one of the reasons why ! don't
think mothers should put any foods on a
"good" or "bad" list, even sweets. Any
food is appropriate as long as it doesn't
make a child sick. I'm not suggesting
that you provide candy bars for dessert
fit every meal, but offering cookies or icc
cream on occasion is linc.

Are peanuts really bad for toddlers'?
      Yes. Small round or hard foods like
peanuts or hot dogs can become lodged
m a small child's windpipe, producing
anything from pneumonia to complete
blockage of the airway. Pediatricians
strongly discourage feeding toddlers
small, hard foods.

Q. is breast milk really better for my
newborn daughter? I prefer to bottle
feed, but my mother-in-law is making
me feel terribly guilty about my choice.
A. Breast milk is the optimal food for
babies, but as far as growth and develop-
meat are concerned, there is little differ-
ence between formula-fed and breast-
fed infants. If your baby is average and
healthy, you aren't putting her at any
risk by choosing formula.

Q. When is the best time to wean a baby
from the breast or bottle?
A. There is no "best" time. Babies may

 be weaned fit any time, but we recom-
 mend breast-feeding through as much of
 the infant's first year tis possible.

 jHow often should a newborn be fed'/
       Feeding a newborn is a compromise
 between on demand and what's possible
 for the mother. On average, babies are
 fed every two to three hours.

 Q. My ten-year-old daughter's appetite
 has recently jumped up considerably.
 Soddenly she's asking for second help-
 ings and nibbling after school. Why this
 change?
 A. The average ten-year-old girl is about
 to go through a phenomenal growth
 spurt. Your daughter is eating more be-
 cause girls grow rapidly as their hormones
 shift toward adolescence and thc onset of
 menstruation and puberty begins.

 Q. My friend makes all her own baby
 food. Is her child better nourished as a
 result?
 A. No. Commercially prepared baby
 food is a perfectly acceptable choice for
 parents to make,

 Q. How important is fruit in a child's
 diet?
 A. Fruit has vitamins, minerals, fiber,
 find can supply a child with energy. You
 find the same nutrients in other foods,
 but fruit is tasty and Iow-fat, too.

 Q. Obesity runs in my husband's fam-
 ily, and my seven-year-old son has a big
 appetite. How can ! limit his diet with-
 out turning into a nag?
A. If he is growing consistently and his
weight is not far out of line for his
height, there may be no reason to be
concerned. At seven, active children eat
to meet their growth and energy needs.
However, if your pediatrician tells you
that your child is quite heavy for his
height, you may want to think about
lower-calorie alternatives to some of his
favorite foods. But don't nag and don't
worry. Emphasize the value of exercise
and try to provide the right balance of
toods.

Q. During busy workweeks, making
meals is difficult. My children love fast-
food dinners, but 1 worry about relying
on "junk." How bad is a steady take-out-
diet?
A. There is nothing wrong with take-out
food as long as you don't order the same
thing all the time, Pizza and hamburgers,
in particular, can have lots of fat and
salt. So order pizza one night, then
turkey or broiled chicken sandwiches the
next, and after that hamburgers or pizza
(without the extra cheese, pepperoni, or
sausage that adds fat). Round out the
meals with a salad and offer plenty of
fruit.

Q. is it true that eating rice or drinking
the water in which rice has been cooked
will help a child recover from diarrhea?
A. In third-world countries, when chil-

dren have an acute bout of diarrhca.
they are often replenished with a cooked
rice solution, either the rice itself or the
water that comes off the top. There is
nothing magical about this approach. As
a rule, when a youngster has diarrhea.
it's important to maintain hydration by
providing appropriate fluids, and to em-
phasize a diet rich in starches, grains.
and vegetables. '~'
