Using TurboCAD, you can design, and more importantly, refine all kinds of projects. You'll get better results
because you see what the "finished product" will look like before you start your work. You can effortlessly
change your design until it's just right...before you commit valuable resources.

You can use your PC to convert your imagination into shapes, dimensions, spaces, areas, flows, symbols,
connections, and more. All with precision and blinding speed.

In fact, it's so good at what it does, you'll find yourself coming up with more good ideas than you
thought possible.

What kind of projects is TurboCAD good for? How about:
     Interior layouts for home and office                          Network diagrams
     Floor plans for new buildings and additions                   Plumbing diagrams
     Printed circuit board schematics                              Electronic diagrams
     Landscape design                                              Technical diagrams
     Furniture layouts                                             Flow charts, schedules and more!

I'd say if you can visualize it, and you want it precise, then it's a TurboCAD project.

                       What TurboCAD Is...
TurboCAD is a complete design tool. It gives you an easy way to sketch your ideas, then automatically
turn them into complete, detailed drawings, with accurate, written-in dimensions, specifications, and
even a list for a bill of materials. With TurboCAD, you can draw and dimension any kind of detailed design.

TurboCAD is a cinch to learn and use. You can draw standard and irregular shapes to scale. Then put in
the details you want using optional TurboCAD libraries of standard objects. You can accurately size each
object, like a couch, a tree, a window, a PC, or server on a network of PC's. Then you can move each
individual item around at will, to see how it will fit and look in different places.

Better yet, TurboCAD gives you the key tool of top-of-the-line CAD programs: layers, up to 256 of them.
Layers work just like transparent overlays on top of a drawing.

You put as many elements, like couches, resistors, lines, arrows, polygons or whatever, as you like on each
