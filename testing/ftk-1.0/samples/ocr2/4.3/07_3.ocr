remains free to move in a direction parallel to a line with inclination 4.

SLIDE,[master,slave,cfl,cf2,cf3]

      This card specifies the master/slave connection for any slidelines in
the analysis. A maximum of 12 slidelines is allowed.

master-        Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline master side
slave-         Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline slave side
cfl-           Value of the friction coefficient, if fully fixed use -1.
               Otherwise insert the proper value here. t0.}
cf2-           Value of slideline overlap tolerance to determine when contact of
               surfaces does occur.t2% of the Master element side length}
cf3-           Value of stress for release of slave node from master surface.
               Value is set to no release,a non-zero value is required to activate
               this option, t0.}
