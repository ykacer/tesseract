WINE & SPIRITS

Tasting Panel Report

COLOR US BUSY THIS MONTH' WE'VE FOUND A GREAT
bike-and-wine trip in Italy, a superb guidebook to go with
it, a spirit from Australia and a crisp, delightful white wine
made at an estate with a seventeenth-century palace overlooking the
Rhine. That's a lot of territory to cover on one page. Have a look.

                    The Top 10
         Here are your best bets for the month, selected by the Bon App~tit
         Tasting Panel, which meets weekly under the direction of wine and
         spirits editor Anthony Dias Blue and his associate, Jack R. Weiner.

          1990 Parducci Wine Cellars, Johannisberg Riesling, North Coast ($6).
            Snappy' with lively acidity and fine apple and peach nuances.

            1992 Jacob's Creek, Chardonnay, South Eastern Australia ($8).
           A charming white that's crisp and lively with great clean fruit.

          1991 Prosper Maufoux, C6tes du Rh6ne, France ($8). A dense red wine
          featuring "leathery, black cherry and peppery fruit and a soft finish,"
          says panel member Peter Kay of The Stouffer Stanford Court hotel.

 1990 The R. H. Phillips Vineyard, Alliance, California (SI0). This
luscious Rh6ne blend is 72 percent Mourv~dre, 19 percent Syrah
and 9 percent Durif. Round and fruity, plus lovely blackberry and
      smoke flavors; complex and charming.

1988 Brolio, Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy ($12). Crisp and bright;
good spice. One panel member found it "earthy with lots of fruit.'

 1990 Markham Vineyards, Merlot, Napa Valley ($15). Smooth and
 spicy; clean, soft and loaded with round fruit and soft textures.

 1990 Simi Winery, Sendal, Sonoma ($15). A rich and lovely blend
of Sauvignon Blanc and Sdmillon. Woody and dense, accented by
 spice and lots of toasty oak. From Anthony Dias Blue's notes:
        "Complex and very interesting."

 1990 Cronin Vineyards, Chardonnay, Santa Cruz Mountains (S20).
 Rich with lovely vanilla and butterscotch subtleties, plus notes
         of ripe pear; smooth texture.

 1991 Bethel Heights Vineyard, Pinot Noir, Southeast Block, Reserve,
  Estate, Willamette Valley ($24). Smoky and smooth "Ripe
  concentration of rich raspberry flavors," says panel member
     Drake McCarthy of Diamond Wine Merchants.

 1990 Gary Farrell Wines, Pinot Noir, Allen Vineyard, Russian River
 Valley ($28). Rich black cherry and spicy fruit highlighted by soft,
  lively flavors of brown sugar and spice. Extremely attractive.

Through the Grapevine
Here's a nice way to wine and dine
your way through Tuscany, Piedmont
and Italy's other gustatory meccas.
Ciclismo Classico conducts bicycle
tours that include private vineyard
visits and serious restaurant going.
Next month's trip includes a stop at
"La Fiera del Vino," a wine festival in
Asti. Call 800-866-7314 or 617-628-
7314 for more information .... For ref-
erence, you might want to take a copy
of The Wine Roads of Italy by Marc
and Klm Millon. This 529-page paper-
back (HarperCollins, 1993) is packed
with maps and restaurant listings.

Wine of the Month
 Count Matuschka-Greiffenclau is an
 articulate German vintner who runs
 Schloss Vollrads, a historic winery on
 the Rhine in the Rheingau. This
 ancient estate has produced wine for
 nearly eight hundred years. In recent
 vintages Matuschka has focused on
 making well-balanced dry wines that
 retain their fruit. An excellent example
 is the 1990 Schloss Vollrads, Rhein-
 gau Riesling, Spiidese, Rosasilber
 Oeft), a crisp halbtrocken (half dry)
 wine that has wonderful orange and
 peach flavors. It's $25 a botde.

 Spirit of the Month
 Stubbs is a white rum that differs in a
 few ways from its Caribbean cousins.
 For one thing, it's made in Queens-
 land, Australia. For another, it's dis-
 tilled from the clear, fresh juice of
 sugarcane, not from dark molasses.
 The result is an exceptionally dry and
 elegant spirit that not only mixes
 nicely with tonic but also is delicious
 on the rocks. A real conversation
 starter for only $14..i~
