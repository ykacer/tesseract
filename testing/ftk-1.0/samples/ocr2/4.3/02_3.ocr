R)      Retention factors

        The variation of the retention factors with distance is
                                    xh)
        expressed in analytic form R - G+H · --

        where the constants are given in the tables below for the
        two sets of retention factors for which calculations have
        been made.

Case 4 a

This case is based on the basic set of parameter values from
case 1 but with a lateral dispersion added.
