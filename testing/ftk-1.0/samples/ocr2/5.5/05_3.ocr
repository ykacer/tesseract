I How can I help save
the environment?

I want to help preserve our

beleaguered envi-

ronment, but am
not certain we

can trust the
claims made
for products
that are sup-
posed to work.

Are there official ~
standards for "re-

cycled" and "degradable "?

To evaluate environmental claims,
look for product labels with specific
information about the product or its
packaging. For example, if a label
says recycled, check how much of the
product or packaging is recycled.
    A growing number of labels on
recycled products tell where the recy-
cled material comes from. Post-Con-
sumer material comes from previous-
ly used business and consumer
products such as newspapers, plastic
bottles, glass containers and alu-
minum cans. Pre-Consumer material,
in contrast, is basically manufacturing
waste. For example, an envelope man-
ufacturer might take the clippings left
over when envelopes are cut from
paper and recycle them into other
paper products.
    Recyclable on the label means the
item can be collected and made into
useful products. This is relevant to
you, however, only if the material is
collected for recycling in your com-
munity. Contact your local recycling
office, trash-collection company or
scrap dealer for this information.
    Biodegradable materials like food
and leaves, when exposed to air,
moisture, and bacteria or other organ-
isms, break down and decompose into
elements found in nature. Pho-
todegradable materials, usually plas-
tics, disintegrate into smaller pieces
when exposed to enough sunlight.
  Either way, degradation of any

material occurs slowly in landfills,
where most trash is sent. That's
because the law requires that modem
· landfills be designed to minimize

the entry of sunlight, air and mois-    ture. While this helps prevent
t pollutants from entering the air
   and drinking-water supplies, it

also slows decomposition.

Even organic materials

(paper, food, etc.) can
take decades to de-
compose in a landfill.
Composting, on the

other hand, takes
advantage of degrad-

    ability, and turns organic
materials into a useful humus-
like substance that enriches the

soil and returns nutrients to the
earth. When you see a com-
postable claim on a product or
package, check to be sure you

have access in your com-

munity to a facility that

accepts that material for'"
composting.

Cleaning products (detergents,

shampoos, and the like) are often
labeled biodegradable. In general,
most such products will degrade in
wastewater systems--and they have
done so for years. --Excerpted from

I>Who can help solve
consumer complaints?
My local appliance store sold me a
de)~ctive product. I can't get the man-
ager to honor the guarantee, nor can
I afford to hire a lawyer to sue. What
can I do?

You might contact Call for Action, an
international nonprofit network that

providesfi'ee and confidential media-
tion services to both troubled con-
sumers and small businesses victim-
ized by fraud. Over the years the
organization has retrieved hundreds of
millions of dollars and resolved 90
percent of its cases.
    For 30 years now CFA has been
doing what it does best: educating,
mediating and advising the public.
"The consumer complaint stops here;'
says Shirley L. Rooker, CFA presi-
dent. "Unlike some consumer hotlines
that only collect data and

refer the consumer

elsewhere, we

offer individ-
uals who have

been ripped off
a sympathetic
ear and a help-

ing hand until

their cases are

finally resolved."

I> What is 'Social
Security integration'?
My employer offers a pension plan
with benefits determined by length of
service and salary. The plan applies
something called "Social Security
integration" that, I am told, reduces
the pension check by half. Can you
explain what this is and how it works?

It's common practice to use Social
Security integration, also known as
"permitted disparity." Under it, the
amount of your Social Security bene-
fit is included when calculating your
total retirement benefit--which may
well leave you with a smaller pension
check than you expected.
  This practice is specifically al-
