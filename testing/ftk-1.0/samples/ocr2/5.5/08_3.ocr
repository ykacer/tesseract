Republicans Find Progressive Religion
In Push to Tax Worker Health Benefits

    WASHINGTON - Conservative Repub-
licans are sounding an old-fashioned Dem-
ocratic theme, redistribution of wealth by
making the federal Tax Code more pro-
gressive, as they challenge the Clinton
health-reform plan.
    With striking unity, Republican alter-
natives to the Clinton plan take aim at
current tax rules sheltering employer-paid
health benefits. No less than the conserva-
tive Heritage Foundation is leading an
effort to wipe out the entire $74 billion-a-
year tax break for individuals and reallo-
cate the money as a tax credit to help low-
and middle-income families buy health
insurance.
    The goal isn't to soak the rich so much
as to avoid government price controls and
use the Tax Code to make consumers more
cost-conscious. But liberal rhetoric pro-
vides a useful rationale.
Powerful Lure
    Organized labor remains the biggest
barrier to taxing benefits, but it may have
to rethink its position. The success of the
Clinton initiative in Congress rests on
finding new revenue to finance expanded
coverage and subsidies for small busi-
nesses. The money that could be raised by
limiting the tax break is inviting to Demo-
crats, who may urge labor to shift its
stance to help placate small business.
    "This is high on the list of things that
make us nervous about health care," said
Gerry Shea, director of the employee bene*
fits section of the AFL-CIO. "This is a big
pile of money, it's just an easy target."
Union leaders have begun a letter-writing
campaign aimed at Ways and Means
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) and
his Senate Finance counterpart, Chairman
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.).
    Still, taxing health benefits, for the
wealthy at least, was among the options
discussed by House Ways and Means Com-
mittee Democrats last week. And pro-labor
lawmakers showed support for the idea in
the panel's health subcommittee last
month.
    The White House has kept a low profile
on the tax issue. Many of its health-care
financing options, such as cigarette and
payroll taxes, would fall heavily on largely

Democratic, working-class families. Econ-
omists say its proposal to require business
to help pay for workers' insurance would
eat into wages as well.
    The administration has relied so far on
direct subsidies to offset higher costs and
give a more progressive cast to its pack-
age. But this approach would be expensive.
The idea of trimming tax benefits instead,
and recycling the savings to help lower-
income families pay health bills, strikes
many as more efficient.
    Despite labor's blue-collar rhetoric in
favor of the tax shelter for health benefits,
most studies show that the current ar-
rangement really does favor the wealthy.
The Congressional Budget Office last
month estimated that the tax break for a
family earning $20,000 to $30,000 averages
$500 a year, compared with $1,590 for those
earning $75,000 to $100,000.
    But the tax break is difficult to attack
because so many households share in the
benefit; while the rich get more in dollars,
the shelter also is important to the far more
numerous middle-income families. The
CBO report shows the average benefit is a
strikingly consistent 2.3% of after-tax in-
come for families with income of $20,000 to
$100,000.
    Ultimately, the debate may turn on
where to cut off the tax break and how to
recycle the resulting revenue. While the
Heritage plan would do away with the
shelter entirely for individuals, several
variations would set a cap on the employer
or employee side of the ledger, or both. A
plan proposed by Rep. Jim McCrery (R.,
La.), for instance, would limit the tax
exclusion for individuals, and the tax
deduction for employers, to $2,500 for an
adult or $5,000 for a familyk
    A $5,000 cap wouldn't affect a worker
making $40,000 a year with $5,000 in family
health benefits. A $4,000 cap, by contrast,
would cost such a worker $150 more in
taxes, assuming a 15% tax rate.
Progressive Phasing Out
    One option for Democrats would be to
phase out the tax preferences at higher-
income levels. Individuals earning $40,000
Or less could be left untouched, for in-
stance, and the exclusion could be progres-
sively reduced at higher income levels
