    Eldorado Rand group. The Eldorado Rand group (No. i88, pl. 2)
comprises three patented claims and 24 unpatented claims. The bulk of the
production, amounting to perhaps $~,ooo,ooo, has been from two of the
patented claims, the Quaker City and the Rand. There are approximately
6,ooo feet of underground workings on the Quaker City claim, including the
35o-foot Rand shaft. The workings explore veins in quartz monzonite.
    The Quaker City claim is 1.75 miles west of Nelson, near the head of
Eldorado Canyon. According to Ransome 0907, p. 77), "At the Quake/'
City there are two parallel, nearly horizontal veins about xoo feet apart, the
upper one being exposed along the hillside for at least 1,2oo feet. The average
dip of these veins is i5°, in a direction a little east of north. They have been
extensively stoped, in many places to a height of 7 feet . . . The ore consists
of shattered quartz monzonite which has been cemented and partly replaced
by calcite and quartz. Originally the deposit contained finely disseminated
pyrite, but this is now oxidized and the material is a free-milling gold ore."
    The Rand shaft, near the Quaker City workings, explores a vein that
strikes N. 7o° E. and dips 80° N. Ransome (i9o7, p. 77) stated, "The vein is
tight and consists of little bunches and veinlets of quartz, calcite, and pyrite
in a somewhat-pyritized quartz monzonite. The lode has produced some
oxidized ore from old workings near the surface . . ."
    The Honest Miner claim, a short distance east of the Rand and Quaker
City, is reportedly the claim on which gold was first discovered in this dis-
trict (Ransome, x9o7, p. 76). The workings explore two nearly parallel
northeast-striking veins about 60 feet apart which dip 45° NW. cutting fine-
grained quartz monzonite. Ransome 0907, p. 77) reported that ore was
produced from the upper parts of the veins. The vein material consists of
quartz and calcite with specks of limonite.

                               Copper King District
Location
    The Copper King (Key West, Bunkerville) district is in the Virgin
Mountains, in T. ~5 S., R. 7° E. The principal properties in the district
(pl. i2) lie about lo miles south of the town of Bunkerville, Nevada. Bunk-
erville is on old U. S. Highway 9I, 33 miles east from the Union Pacific
Railroad station at Moapa, Nevada.
History and production
    Copper ore was discovered in the area in the late 9o's, and later the ore
was also found to contain traces of nickel and platinum. Through the years
several unsuccessful attempts have been made to recover these metals. The:
most recent mining activity in the district has been confined to the develop-i
ment of tungsten and mica-beryl (see p. x59) deposits (Beal, i965).
  Recorded production, from ~9o8 to I962, has been about 3,500 tons of ore:
