AUTOMOTIVE



No, this is not a trick photo.  Nlicrocurs start small, and In their sporty derivatives, got even smaller.
The tiny size is prompted by Japanese regulations aimed at saving space.

      efore you even ask, the answer is
      no. No, you cannot buy the new
 B660-cc, DOHC, three-cylinder, in-
 tercooled, turbocharged Mazda AZ-1
 in the United States, even if you could
 afford its $14,000 sticker price.  The
 plastic-bodied, bumperless micro-rock-
 et would never meet U.S. crash safety
 requirements, and tweaking its 64-
 horsepower engine to pass our emis-
 sions standards would erode the AZ-1's
 40-mpg rating.  But that didn't stop us
 from throwing the mid-engine coupe
 into Manhattan traffic to judge the
 Japanese definition of an urban
 assault vehicle.
   City vehicles need to accelerate
 quickly, stop quickly, and feature good
 mirrors.  The AZ-1 scored well in all
 three departments.  Acceleration off
 stop lights was brilliant, especially
 when the turbo kicked in with a
 scream at around 3,000 rpm.  Four-
 wheel disc brakes quickly checked the
 1,587-pound car's excess speed and
 the mirrors gave an ample view of the
 New York traffic around us.  Steering
 was nimble and sure.  Japan-market
 city cars are, in some ways, an urban
 commuter's dream.
   The AZ-1 failed on two key points,
 however.  Potholes ingested its little
 13-inch wheels and strained the four-
 wheel independent suspension; also,
 the car's cute appearance and gull-
 wing doors drew crowds anywhere it
 was parked.  That suggests it would
 also attract thieves.



   At just less than 11 feet long, the
 car had no parking problems in New
 York.  And it magically swallowed a
 six-foot-tall test driver and a six-foot-
 three-inch photographer.  Getting in
 and out of the car, however, required
 the agility of a gymnast.
   A worthy road warrior?  You bet.  But
 one you won't soon see in midtown
 rush hour traffic.-Sandy Fritz

      LEm Cm LicKs NOx

         ider use of fuel-efficient lean-
         burn engines has been
 Wstymied by a major problem:
 oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions.  As
 fuel mixtures get leaner, exhaust gas-
 es become oxygen-rich.  Excess oxygen
 makes it dffficult for current catalysts
 to deoxidize NOx.  For carmakers with
 lean-burn engines, an effective NOx
 catalyst has been the Holy Grail.
    Mazda claims to have found it-at
 least a version adequate for the
 Japanese market.  The company re-
 cently announced a three-way catalyst
 that removes hydrocarbons, carbon
 monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from
 lean-burn engine exhaust.
    The catalyst is based on the mineral
 zeohte, which is coated with a precious
 metal Mazda won!t identify The com-
 pany says it has confirmed the durabil-
 ity of the new catalyst in bench tests.
    For drivers, the benefit is fuel effi-
 ciency.  The Mazda catalyst allows
 lean-bum operation over a wider range
 of driving conditions than current lean-
 burn engines, boosting fuel economy
 from 5 percent to 8 percent.
    The new catalyst does not yet meet
 Cahfoni&s strict NOx limits, however.
