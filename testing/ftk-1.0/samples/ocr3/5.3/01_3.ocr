FAMILY AMUSEMENTS



 A vacationing family can spend a small fortune visiting amusement parks, so it pays to plan ahead and to look into discounts.
 Every amusement park in the country has a posted admission charge, but often those prices can be beaten through discount
 offers and local-sponsor deals.  To find out more, call the park directly.  The following full-fare prices are for one-day admis-
 sion. These parks are the top I 0, based on 1992 attendance.                                        - Tim O'Brien
