  making process, either in small teams or
  individually," says Jeanette Headrick, a 51-
  year-old who joined Collins & Aikman six
  years ago, just when the troubles had come
  to ahead.  Headrick, now coordinator ofthe
  carpet-installation department, gives credit
  for the company's success to the empow-
  erment-training program facilitated by
  Pecos River Learning Centers of Santa Fe,
  N.M., and Executive Quality Management
  of Spartanburg, S.C. During the two-day
  program, Headrick and her colleagues par-
  ticipated in a series of exercises, such as
  scaling a 42400t wall in groups of three
  linked together with rope, much as their
  fates within the company would be linked.
  Teammates on the ground held belay ropes
  and told their climbers where to place their
  feet and hands.  For Headrick, a perfec-
  tionist, the wall was a Waterloo: "I had to
  make a decision, after talking to my team-
  mates, that I was not able to climb the wall.
  They had to come down with me, so it kept
  them from climbing it, too." In the end, she
  says, she and her teammates learned how
  to work much more harmoniously.  "Every-
  one has their own wall, and you learn to be
  more tolerant", she explains.
     As a result of programs like this one,
  floor,coverings,division employees have,
  over the last two years, suggested over
  i,8oo ways to change procedures, pro-
  cesses and products.  Roughly 75 percent
  of their ideas have been adopted.  One
  team of employees reduced the waste
  from cutting carpet into tiles by go per-
  cent.  All facets of quality have improved.
  The division has won four awards for
  excellence in design from the Institute of
  Business Designers.
     Morale has also improved.  Employee
  turnover fell from 27 percent in ig8g to I4
  percent last year.  And absenteeism
  declined from 3.4 to 2 percent, the indus-
  try average, in spite of the fact that
  employees are encouraged to take time off
  when they need it, rather than penalized
  for missing work.
     Unlike Collins & Aikman Textile
  Group, spurred by crisis, the Taylor group
  of companies moved to participative man-
  agement out of foresight.  James Taylor,
  president and CEO, and his brotherjohn,
  treasurer, are third-generation managers
  of the boat-accessories subsidiary, Nelson
  A. Taylor, based in Gloversville, N.Y., that
  their grandfather started in igo8.  The par-
  ent company employs over 500 people in
  six plants scattered about the U.S., Ireland



 and Canada.  During the mid-8os, the sub-
 sidiary, an industry leader best known for
 windshields and window glass, was riding
 the wave of strong growth that was sweep-
 ing the marine industry.  That was making
 the Taylors nervous."We had managed the
 company as a benevolent dictatorship,"
 says James.  "But I started to realize that the
 old way of doing things just wasn't going
 to work in the future." His search for new
 ideas came to an end when he discovered
 Stayer's Harvard Business Review article.
   The Taylors have been working on
 changing their company for almost three
 years now, and they both feel strongly
 that they have done the right thing.  But
 every step has been painful, and the
 brothers agree: "You can't let your ego



 get in the way," says 49-year-old James,
 whose tone lets you know he has tripped
 over his own ego more times than he
 cares to count."You have to change your-
 self," says John, 42.  "The organization is
 only a reflection of the people.  So if all
 the people believe in top-down manage-
 ment, the organization is top-down." Like
 Eitel, the Taylors learned early on that
 empowerment cannot coexist with fear.
 James realized he would have to learn to
 shut up when he heard, during an early
 self-management meeting, that some of his
 people had coined the word "Jimidation."
    Initially, it was as hard for the workers
 to take responsibility as it was for the Tay-
 lors to relinquish it.  "The first team we ever
 formed was one to come up with new work
 rules," says James.  After a few weeks, sev-
 eral workers told him to write the rules him-
 self.  AU that's changing now.  Workers at
 each plant have written new rules for work
 and compensation, and some teams even do
 the hiring.  The human-resources depart-
 ment supports them by administering ben-
 efits and assisting in locating candidates to
 hire.  And the managers have become coach-
 es. Says John, "One job is to outline certain
 legal and ethical parameters things have to
 be within, and to measure everything we
 do against the needs of our customers."
   Without empowerment, says James,
 Nelson A- Taylor would very likely have
 sunk last year, when the industry's rev-
 enues fell by nearly half from'89.  But the
 company rode out the storm.

 CAR WARS The most widely noted
 American empowerment success is also at
 one of the biggest companies that adhere
 to this ideology@General Motors.  Not
 long ago, few experts would have predict-
 ed that an all-new American car could
 have matched the reliability of Toyotas
 and Hondas.  But for the second year in a
 row, GM's Saturn has done just that,
 according to the current annual auto issue
 of Consumer Reports.
   Some credit must go to the Saturn
 plant's managers, who from the start
 were determined to build the best Amer-
 ican car ever.  But credit must go also to
 workers-and empowerment.  Mercedes
 Benz's 3oo and igo series, veritable
 tapestries of fine engineering, are signif-
 icantly less reliable than Saturn, says
 Consumer Reports.  But then, Daimler,
 Benz, the manufacturer, is not perceived
 to be as empowered or as lean as Saturn.
