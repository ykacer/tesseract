 After a year on job, secretary finds reach exceeds grasp

        WASHINGTON - Henry Cis-
    neros likes dramatic gestures.
        When a homeless woman died
    outside the Department of Housing
    and Urban Development, the HUD
    secretary appeared at her funeral.
    When the Ku Klux Klan threatened
    black residents of a Texas housing
    project, Cisneros seized control of
    the local housing authority to force
    integration.  When an earthquake hit
    Los Angeles, Cisneros dashed to the
    scene and stayed for two weeks.
        No one is saying the drama is
    meaningless.  Even Cisneros' harsh-
    est critics, who accuse him of show-
    manship for political gain, concede
    that the 46-year-old former mayor of
    San Antonio seems to mean well.
    But, by most accounts, what he has
    accomplished in a little over a year
    still falls far short of his goals.
        Cisneros says it is too early to
    judge him.  His critics are skeptical
    that he will ever live up to his goals -
    in part because his approach is
    sometimes inefficient and in part be-
    cause his aims are so ambitious as to
    be unachievable.
        Consider Cisneros' reaction
    when he walks by a panhandler.
    Against the advice of experts, Cis-
    neros conceded in a recent interview,
    he reaches into his pocket for
    change.
        "I know that some may be using
    that for alcohol or other substance
    abuse," Cisneros said.  "But if I can
    help others, then I don't mind."
        Cisneros has set reducing the
    number of homeless people on the
    streets as his top priority.  He reels
    off his five lesser priorities improve
    public housing, expand opportunities
    for private housing, combat housing
    discrimination, empower poor com-
    munities to develop economically
    and reform HUD's management
    style.
        In the Clinton Cabinet, Cisneros
    has taken the role of champion of the
    underdog, which critics argue has let
    other Cabinet members off the hook
    too easily.  His colleagues respect his



 Reno, Cisneros is the Cabinet mem-
 ber who most seems to delight in
 rubbing elbows with the public.  Like
 the president, Cisneros enjoys both
 "town hall" meetings and one-on-one
 chats.  He knows the art of listening.
    Friends of the secretary say all
 the outreach leaves little time for a
 private life.  Cisneros tries hard to
 spend some evenings at home with
 his wife, Mary Alice.  His 6-year-old
 son, John Paul - named after the
 pope - recently underwent major
 heart surgery.
     Cisneros' decision to attend the
 funeral of Yetta Adams, the woman
 who died on HUD's doorstep in De-
 cember, was characteristic of his at-
 tempts to rekindle a feeling of ur-
 gency about a social problem.  The
 president has left the homeless issue
 almost exclusively to Cisneros, al-
 though Clinton's budget would dou-



     "This is a new day," Cisneros de-
  clared, vowing that if necessary he
  would summon federal marshals to
  protect future black tenants.
     Cisneros and his assistant secre-
  tary for fair housing, Roberta Ach-
  tenberg, won praise from civil rights
  groups for conceding that racial dis-
  crimination within the public housing
  system is rampant.  By contrast, dur-
  ing the Bush and Reagan years,
  HUD denied bias in dozens of court
  battles.  The agency is now likely to
  settle most of those suits, Achten-
  berg said.
     In other areas, such as fixing up
  its public housing and fostering eeo-
  nomic development in poor neigh-
  borhoods, critics say HUD is a long
  way from offering solutions.
     Last week, Cisneros outlined re-
  forms designed to eliminate or con-
  solidate 59 HUI) programs.  He also
  vowed to let local housing officials
  use modernization funds to replace
  run-down public housing units with
  new units - a financing tool that,
  could rid the country of some of its
  worst public housing high-rises.
     Cisneros has also committed
  himself to continuing former HUD
  Secretary Jack Kemp's program to
  sell public housing units to tenants.
  But in many developments, HUD is
  still a slumlord.  At the same time,
  families may wait years for a public,
  housing unit or a rent subsidy.  In
  1993, HUD had only 10.6 million
  units to meet the needs of an esti-
  mated 14.3 million people.
     Michael Kane, director of the
  Boston HUD Tenant Alliance, is
  skeptical of the plan to decentralize
  HUD - a pet idea of Cisneros'.  "The
  career bureaucracy is not going to
  change," Kane said.
     Yet in an interview Cisneros in-
  sisted that "reinventing HUD is very
  real." He grabbed a a pen and
  sketched a pyramid representing the
  distribution of the agency's 13,500
  employees.  Then he turned the
  sketch upside down to show how
  power would shift to workers in the
  field.
