  ond-largest network of free-
  standing dialysis centers, lag-
  ging only W.R. Grace's.  It now
  treats more than 150,000 pa-
  tients at more than 130 centers
  nationwide, grabbing an ever
  larger slice of market share in a
  highly fragmented industry.
  More recently, it entered the
  outpatient surgery market by
  acquiring two surgical centers,
  which account for less than 5%
  of revenues, but which, Aster
  predicts, also will grow rapidly.
     Various          contemporary
  trends favor Vivra's continued
  growth, including industry con-
  solidation, the overall aging of
  the population and continued
  advances in medical technology



that further expand the scope of
outpatient services.  But the cur-
rent debate on national health
care also raises a red flag, Aster
admits, especially since more
than two-thirds of Vivra's dia-
lysis revenues are paid by Medi-
care - and Medicare's reim-
bursements already are lower
than they were 10 years ago.
There's talk in Washington of
increasing dialysis payments by
2.5% a year, he adds, but
whether the increase will actu-
ally go through remains any-
one's guess.
    On the other hand, Aster
avers, reduced payments would
drive out more marginal opera-
tors, giving Vivra even more



 market share, "so they win either
 way, in my opinion." Boasting
 64 a very strong balance sheet," an
 18% return on equity and a stock
 price only 14.5 times 1994 earn-
 ings, Vivra is, to Aster's way of
 thinking, an inexpensive stock
 with a strong growth potential.
 Those earnings, he adds, should
 come in around $1.80 a share
 this year and $2.20 in 1994.







    Portfolio Analysis Of
 Selected Fixed-Income Funds



(Market) Timing Is Everything



By RANDALL W. FORSYTH



      ARKET timing has a bad
 M name, especially in mu-
 tual-fand land.  The funds don't
 like it and most investors lose
 more than they make.
     Paul Merriman dissents.  He
 insists that market timing does
 work, particularly with bond
 funds.  Combining risky types of
 bond funds, moreover, actually
 reduces risks, he also contends.
 To buy and hold a government
 bond fund is what's really risky,
 he adds.
     At the beginning of this year,
 the Merriman Flexible Bond
 Fund adopted market timing,
 a strategy Merriman also uses to
 manage individuals' money.
 The fund invests in other bond
 funds, which he says affords the
 advantages of greater liquidity
 and management expertise in
 various sectors.  He admits
 there's an extra cost - his man-
 agement fee overlaid on those of
 the funds, resulting in an ex-
 pense ratio of 1.51%. But even
 though the fund is small -about



 the other zags.  Global bonds and
 domestic junk are good comple-
 ments precisely because they're
 usually out of sync.  When the
 U.S. economy is weak, foreign
 bonds produce strong returns
 because the dollar and rates are
 falling while economically sensi-
 tive junk lags.  Conversely, junk
 is strong during expansions
 while foreign bonds lag because
 of a rising greenback and climb-
 ing interest rates.
    Merriman demonstrates by
 combining two highly regarded
 funds in each category, the T.
 Rowe Price International Bond
 Fund with the Federated High
 Yield Bond Fund, for the last
 four and a half years.  That
 period includes a recession, the
 junk-bond market meltdown
 and wide swings in the dollar.
 For the span, the Price Interna-
 tional Fund returned an average
 of 9.5% annually while the Fed-
 eratedjunk fund returned 11.9%
 annually, Merriman calculates
 (after deducting his manage-



 being out of the junk market
 during the 1989-90 collapse.
    Barron's readers can emulate
 Merriman's methods using no-
 load bond funds and a simpli-
 fiedversionofhismarket-t' '
 system, which he says is purely
 trend-following.    Unlike the
 more volatile stock market,
 bonds have well-defined trends,
 which makes catching the turn-
 ing points easier.
    The do-it-yourself formula is
 easy but requires daily updating
 and discipline, Merriman points
 out.  Quite simply, if the fund's
 net-asset value falls 3%, either
 from your original purchase
 price or its most recent high,
 switch into a money-market
 fund.  Continue to track it on the
 way down.  When it hits a low
 and rises 3% from that low,
 switch back into the bond fund.
 While you'll miss absolute mar-
 ket tops and bottoms, you'll tend
 to miss big declines and stay
 invested most other times.
     As for which funds he uses,
 Merriman says he sticks to no-
 load funds with management
 continuity and strong one-,
