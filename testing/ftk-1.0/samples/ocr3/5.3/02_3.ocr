     M-1 Costs Rise

               HE COST of
               obtaining gov-
               ernment rifles
               used by Legion
               Posts' color and
  honor guards has tripled in
  recent months to more than
  $150 per rifle for shipping
  and handling.  The ceremo-
  nial rifles are loaned free to
  Posts by the government
  arsenal at Anniston, Ala.
  Posts must pay shipping and
  handling fees.  As recently
  as six months ago, a WWII-
  era, .30-caliber M-1 Garand
  rifle cost Posts about $50
  each in these fees.
    Army officials blamed the
  increases on personnel and
  budget cutbacks.  They are
  aware that many Posts can-
  not afford the $150 price tag
  and are looking for ways to
  lower the price, if possible.
    As prescribed by the
  Legion's Manual of Cere-
  monies, Posts must send
  their requests for rifles and
  blank ammunition to: Exec-
  utive Director, The Ameri-
  can Legion Washington
  Office, 1608 K St., Wash-
  ington, DC 20006.           E

VIDEO OPPOSES SAYS IN MILITARY



             N A new video,
             Our Military
             Under Siege,
             National Com-
             mander Roger
A. Munson and other mili-
tary experts speak out
against lifting the ban on
homosexuals in the U.S.
Armed Forces.  Produced by
the Defense Readiness
Foundation, the 35-minute
video outlines the many
problems that will arise if
the ban against homosexu-
als in the military is lifted.
   In his video appearance,
Munson explains that the



 Congress, not the President,
 is responsible for making
 the rules and regulations
 governing the military.
 "This video would be
 appropriate for Legion
 meetings or to give to local
 cable access channels,"
 Munson says.
