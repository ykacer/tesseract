  The problem with PC
            eing politically correct-PC-at
            college is more than simply having
            "correct" political views.  It con-
            notes a certain attitudes
            consciousness.  PC was originally
            supposed to ensure that students
  in diverse college communities were sensi-
  tive to ethnic differences and used nondis-
  criminatory and inoffensive language.  All
  good intentions.  But being PC isn't just
  about the language you use.  It's the clothes
  you buy, the music you listen to, and every-
  thing you read.  It's the difference between
  Andrew Dice Clay and Jerry Seinfeld.
   My college, Brown University, in Provi-


dence, Rhode Island, is an ac-



tivist place where subtle
 pressure to be politically cor-



rect pervades student



life.  I'm happy to be
at a school where
students take over



 University Hall to demand need-
 blind admissions or sleep in shanty



 towns on The Green in solidarity
 with the homeless, and I defi-



nitely prefer action to apathy.
But sometimes I feel like it's ,



 impossible to be apolitical at my school-it's
 as if there's one way to think and feel about
 a million different issues, and when I don't
 agree with the accepted point of view, or I
 don't have any opinion on an issue, I'm some
 reactionary pig.
   In my freshman year at Brown, I pretty
 much followed along with the PC herd.  I re-
 cycled, I bought a Brown mug to use instead
 of Styrofoam cups, I even came to love those
 Guatemalan sweaters that you can so conve-
 niently purchase at the Brown Post Office.

 fairly liberal all-girls
 high school in New > A
