   Car thieves prefer ragtops.
   And the convertibles of
 choice last year for the dis-
 criminating crook were the
 Volkswagen Cabriolet and
 Ford Mustang, according to
 figures compiled by the High-
 way Loss Data Institute.
   At the bottom of the list of
 cars from 1991 to 1993 was
 the unlovely and - happily
 - unwanted Chevrolet Cava-
 lier station wagon.
   Th-e Virginia-base4 re-



search agency came up with
the list by compiling 1993 in-
surance claims filed with 15
major companies.
  Researchers also found



  that:
  N Car-theft claims were
  made almost twice as often in
  large metropolitan areas as
  in the rest of the country.  De-



  troit led the nation with 21.5
  claims per 1,000 insured ve-
  hicles.
  0 Anti-theft devices that ac-
  tually incapacitate cars, like
  GM's computer PASS-key sys-
  tem, deter car thieves.
  0 The number of theft claims
  for newer cars last year hit a
  new low, but insurance com-
  panies paid more per claim
  than ever before.
    New York's car thieves
  don't follow national norms,
  though, according to police
  figures.  They prefer older,
  boxier cars. with Newswire Service
