  Snyder, managers since 1979 and
  1984, respectively, dividend growth is
  a useful method for spotting outfits
  with strong earnings prospects and
  excess cash flow-that is, profits left
  over after capital outlays and divi-
  dend payouts-which the company
  can use to acquire other firms or to
  buy back the company's stock.  For ex-
  ample, their biggest holding, at 3.5%
  of assets, is Philip Morris, which is ex-
  pected to generate $23 billion in ex-
  cess cash flow over the next five years.
    Snyder and Cameron currently
  have about 20% of the fund's assets in
  bonds and cash.  Those equity hold-
  ings have helped pump up the fund's
  yield to 3.6% and should make Sover-
  eign's share price steadier than aver-
  age in a market downturn.  Even so,
  during the past 10 years Sovereign
  has posted returns that bettered those
  of the average fund by 1.5 percentage
  points a year.  Nervous investors take
  note: The fund has not had a down
  year since 1977.

   @ Investors with a hunger for
  growth should consider this $3.5 bil-
  lion portfolio, which 33-year-old Jeff
  Vinik has run since September 1990.
  Formerly the manager of the top-
  performing Fidelity Contrafund, Vin-
  ik has maintained the 2%-Ioad fund's
  sizzling five-year record, during which
  it outpaced the average equity fund by
  4.5 percentage points a year.  Vinik's
  basic strategy is to search for reason-
  ably priced dividend-paying stocks
  that could grow 15% annually.
     Over the next 12 to 18 months,
  though, Vinik expects medium-size
  stocks to outrun blue chips.  Thus, the
  market capitalization of the fund's av-
  erage company is a relatively nimble
  $1.34 billion, compared with around
  $7 billion for the other funds in this
  article.  If Vinik is right, his mid-size
  stocks could ace the competition in a
  bull market, but they could also fall
  hard in a slump.  To lessen that risk
  during the next few months, Vinik has
  raised the fund's cash allocation from
  3% a year ago to 10% now.  Another
  10% is devoted to bonds, which helps
  to support the fund's 3.7% yield.
