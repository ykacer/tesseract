 More than any other feature, your hair influences
 the way you look.  You can apply your makeup
 perfectly, dress impeccably, but if your hair's not
 right, everythings wrong.  Here, we help four hair-
 hampered women find a style that suits them.



  problems

  *Pale hair color made
  skin look washed-*W.
  *Her too-thick hair was
  dry and damaged.

  solutions

  Changing Marian's hair
  color to dark blonde
  immediately warmed up
  her skin tone.  To get her
  heavy hair under control,
  we clipped off six inches
  of damaged locks, blunt-
  cut the bottom and added
  long layers around her
  face.  Ivoryfoundation,
  camel an@ rust eye
  shadow, and apricot
  blush continued the
  warming trend.
