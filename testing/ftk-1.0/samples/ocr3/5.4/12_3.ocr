  Deputized         Indians patrol sacred site

     Treasure hunters have been looting ancient American Indian
  burial grounds at Moccasin Bend for 50 years, but the sacred site
  near Chattanooga, Tenn., now has some home-grown protection.



    Thirteen mem-
 bers of the Chatta-
 nooga InterTribal
 Association - after
 receiving training
 from the county
 sheriff's depart-
 ment, the district at-
 torney's ofFfce and
 the FBI - have
 joined a newly
 formed sheriff's re-
 serve force and be-
 gun regular armed
 patrols of the 6.4-
 square-mile site.



     Evidence of civilization dating back 12,000 years has been .,
 found at Moccasin Bend, but grave robbers have plundered upto
 1,100 graves since the site was rediscovered a half-century ago.
 "The ground looks like where artillery has come in, the gravedig@
 gers have made so many holes," says Bob Welch, a Cherokee mem-
 b.er of the new patrol.

 0 A PLACE IN THE SUN: Florida nudists, concerned about
 gawkers at the beach, have worked out a deal with federal park
 rangers for privacy at Canaveral National Seashore.  Park offi-
 cials had distributed fliers saying clothing is optional all along the
 24-mile stretch of beach, but the nudists objected.  A revised flier
 will state that nudists generally congregate in areas beyond the
 paved roads at Playalinda and Apollo beaches.  The arrest of nud-
 ists at the park last year led to a court ruling that public nudity in
 Florida is allowed unless it is for lewd or lascivious reasons.

 0 A HOUSE DIVIDED: Richard O'Hara and son Shawn have at
 least one thing in common: Each wants Mississippi Republican
 Trent Lott out of the U.S. Senate.  Richard, 77, is running against
 Lott in the June 7 GOP primary.  Shawn, 36, an evangelist, is run-
 ning for the Democratic nomination and a chance to face Lott in
 November.... Alabama state Sen. Hank Sanders (D-Selma) and
 his law partner, J.L. Chestnut, have both signed up to run for San-
 ders's seat, but there's no animosity between the two.  Chestnut got
 into the race because of talk that local Democrats may dump Sand-
 ers from the ballot to punish him for supporting independent can-
 didates in local races.
