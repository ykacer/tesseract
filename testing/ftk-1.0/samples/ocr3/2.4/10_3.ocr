House re ects bid
for spending cuts



  Congressional Quarterly

      House lawmakers Thursday
  narrowly rejected 202-216 an at-
  tempt to put the House on record
  as supporting Senate-approved
  language calling for additional
  spending cuts over the next five
  years.
      The House and the Senate
  have already approved their re-
  spective versions of the fiscal 1995
  budget blueprint.  The key differ-
  ence between the two versions is
  that the Senate version includes an
  additional $26.1-billion in spending
  cuts over five years.
      House and Senate conferees
  will now meet to agree on a com-
  promise version of the budget
  plan.
      Advocates of increased deficit
  reduction, led by Timothy J. Pen-
  ny, D-Minn., and John R. Kasich,
  R-Ohio, had hoped to compel
  House conferees to accept the
  Senate spending cut.
      "Let's just say yes one time to
  one spending cut, on a bipartisan
  basis," said Kasich.
      Opponents of the Penny-Kasich
  amendment argued that the Sen-
  ate cut would take needed money
  away from national defense, educa-
  tion and criminal justice.
      Voting to urge House confer-
  ees to accept $26-billion in spend-
  ing cuts: Canady (R), Fowler (R),
  Lewis (R), McCollum (R), Mica
  (R), Miller (R), Ros-Lehtinen (R),
  Stearns (R).
      Voting against: Bacchus (D),
  Brown (D), Gibbons (D), Hutto
  (1)), Johnston (1)), Meek (D),
  Peterson (D), Thurman (D), Bili-
  rakis (R), Goss (R), Young (R).
      E House upholds death
  penalty: Liberal lawmakers suf-
  fered a setback Thursday as the
  House rejected a death penalty
  substitute as part of the $15-billion
  anti-crime bill. -
      The amendment, which would
  have replaced life in prison for all
  crim4es subject to the bill's death
  penalty provisions, failed by a vote
  of 111-314.
      While support for the amend-



  ment came overwhelmingly from
  Democrats, 149 Democrats op-
  posed it.  Six Republicans voted
  yes.  Amendment supporters ar-
  gued that the death penalty costs
  too much, fails to deter crime and
  encroaches on state judicial over-
  sight.
     But opponents said the death
  penalty is the sternest conse-
  quence for those who commit vi-
  cious crimes.
     Other attempts to exempt fed-
  eral crimes from the death penalty
  also failed, and lawmakers ap-
  proved amendments to make it
  easier to impose the death penalty
  on criminals.  The House is expec-
  ted to vote on the, anti-crime bill
  this week.
     Voting to replace the death
  penalty with life imprisonment:
  Meek (D).
     Voting to oppose: Bacchus (D),
  Brown (D), Gibbons (D), Hutto
  (D), Johnston (D), Peterson (D),
  Thurman (D), Bilirakis (R), Canady
  (R), Fowler (R), Goss (R), Lewis
  (R), McCollum (R), Mica (R), Mill-
  er (R), Ros-Lehtinen (R), Stearns
  (R), Young (R).
     0 Senate votes to restrict
  desert development: After
  eight years of on-and-off debate,
  the Senate on Wednesday passed
  69-29 a measure that would re-
  strict development on a vast por-
  tion of California desert and create
  three new national parks. ,
     The bill, sponsored by Califor-
  nia Democrat Dianne Feinstein,
  would protect more than one-third
  of the California desert's 25-mil-
  lion acres.  It is the largest land
  protection measure considered by
  Congress since the passage of the
  Alaska Lands Act in 1980.
     Feinstein displayed numerous
  pictures of the desert's unique fea-
  tures in an attempt to convince her
  colleagues that the bill would pro-
  tect more than a vast, parched
  space void of anything but sand.
     Voting to designate new wil-
  derness areas in the California des-
  ert: Graham (D).
     Voting against: Mack (R).
