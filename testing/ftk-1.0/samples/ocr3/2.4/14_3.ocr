 170                 LARE BONNEVILLE.



 Salt Lake.  By reason of its position at the top of the series, it is the most
 conspicuous of all; but the one most deeply carved is the Provo, 375 feet
 lower.  Between the Bonneville and Provo are the Intermediate shore-
 lines, characterized by embankments of great size, but without correspond-
 ingly great sea-cliffs and terraces.  Below the Provo the slopes exhibit lake
 sediments, with occasional shore-lines superposed.  Of these latter the Stans-
 bury is the most prominent.
      The area of the lake at the Bonneville stage. was 19,750 square miles;
 at, the Provo stage, about 13,000 square miles; at the Stansbury stage, about
 7,000 square miles.
      The order of sequence of the shores to which names have been given
 is: first, Intermediate; second, Bonneville; third, Provo; fourth, Stansbury.
 During fiiwperlod of fh@ formation of the Intermediate embankments, there
 were no persistent water stages; but the water surface oscillated up and
 down.  The last additions to the embankments were made during a gen-
 eral advance of the water.  The oscillation of the water surface continued
 through  the Bonneville epoch, the Bonneville shore representing the com-
 bined results of wave action at a series of water levels having a vertical
 range of 20 feet.  The last stage of this series was the highest, and imme-
 diately afterward the surface fell rapidly to the Provo horizon, where it
 remained a long time.  The water margin afterward receded from the
 Provo shore to its present position, halting occasionally by the way, and
 longest at the Stansbury shore.
