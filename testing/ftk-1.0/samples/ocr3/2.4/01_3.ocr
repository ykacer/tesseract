   Figure 2-4 A glaciological reconstruction of the North
   American ice cover between 21,000 and 17,000 BP.  A single
   Laurentide dome is postulated over Hudson Bay because
   postglacial isostatic uplift is greatest there, but the bed was
   frozen beneath this dome because few, if any, erratics of
   Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from Hudson Bay are found on
   the surrounding Precambrian crystalline shield along the ice
   divide.  Ice streams are shown occupying the fore-deepened
   interisland channels on the Arctic continental shelf and in
   the ring of elongated lakes radiating from Hudson Bay and
   located along the outer boundary of the shield.  Floating ice
   tongues and ice shelves may have formed beyond ice streams
   occupying interisland channels.  The extension of a grounded
   portion of the Arctic Ocean ice-shelf cover onto northern
   Alaska is entirely hypothetical, as discussed in Chapter 8.
   Grounded ice lobes and ice fans formed beyond ice streams
   occupying elongated lakes.  Ice shelves probably became par-
   tially grounded as they passed over sills in the narrow straits
   between Baffin Island and Greenland, Greenland and Ice-
   land, Iceland and the Faeroes, and the Faeroes and Scotland.
   The southern Laurentide margin had a surface equilibrium
   line separating an inner accumulation zone from an outer
   ablation zone; the northern margin did not, except where
   katabatic winds flowed down ice streams and into fiords.  A
   basal equilibrium line separating an inner melting zone from
   an intermediate freezing zone was located about midway
   across the Canadian Shield, and a second basal equilibrium
   line separating the intermediate freezing zone from an outer
   melting zone was located near the surface equilibrium line
   along the southern Laurentide margin.  The present divides
   of the Hudson Bay and Grear Lakes watersheds are the ap-
   proximate locations of these'two basal equilibrium lines (see
   Chapters 5 and 6).  Innuitian and Greenland domes are also



  shown, together with minor domes over Nova Scotia, New-
  foundland, Devon Island, Iceland, and elsewhere.  The Cor-
  dilleran ice divide probably had several domes.  Ice-free areas
  existed on the headlands between fiords, particularly in Baf-
  fin Island and Greenland; and on the lee side of islands
  separating ice streams, such as Banks Island.  The pattern of
  flowlines and basal thermal conditions shown is the one used
  for the single-dome maximum Laurentide ice sheet recon-
  struction in Chapter 6. Key: Thick solid lines are ice-sheet or
  ice-cap margins, thick dashed lines are ice-shelf grounding
  lines, thin solid lines are surface flowlines on grounded ice
  sheets or ice caps, and thin dotted lines are their extensions
  on.'floating ice shelves.  Areas covered by large dots have
  thawed or partially thawed beds, with thawed beds beneath
  ice streams and partially thawed beds in zones of basal melt-
  ing or freezing (the density of large dots is qualitatively pro-
  portional to the degree of ice-bed uncoupling due to thawed
  basal conditions).  Areas covered by small dots denote sea ice
  extent (the density of small dots is greatest along sea-ice
  margins).  Black areas are open seas beyond the ice-sheet
  marine margins, and white blocks scattered in the black areas
  represent tabular icebergs calved from these margins (partic-
  ularly from ice shelves and where calving bays are migrating
  up surging ice streams).  Horizontal ruled lines along terres-
  trial ice-sheet margins show sectors bordered by proglacial
  lakes (no attempt is made to show the areal extent of these
  lakes).  Heavy broken lines in Figure 2-4 show the approxi-
  mate inner and outer boundaries of the Canadian Shield.
  Outlines of ice sheets are adapted from Figure 2-2, with
  arbitrary ice borders drawn in places where Figure 2-2 lacks
  information.  Ice shelves are entirely hypothetical and there-
  fore were not depicted in Figure 2-2; the possibility that such
  ice shelves existed is discussed in Chapter 8.
