    the minimum compressive stress at the borehole wall, which is 3 =in -
    amax, is -250 psi, which is tension.  For this weak material the
    borehole has probably broken down just by drilling the borehole.  At
    worst it would require another 200-300 psi more to break down the most
    competent tuff and this is still below the minimum principal in situ
    stress.  Thus, one should not expect to see any breakdown with this
    combination of stresses and hole alignment.
        No data is shownfrom EV6-3 because this hole was drilled upward
    into the welded tuff at +7' and many difficulties were encountered at-
    tempting to fracture this rock.  Some data, which were obtained in three
    zones, were difficult to interpret and no reasonably accurate measure-
    ments could be made.  However, it did appear that the ISIPs or the mini-
    mum principal in situ stresses were exceptionally low; they were-prob-
    ably less than 200 psi and possibly less than 100 psi.
        A detailed study of the vertical distribution of the in situ stres-
    ses was made in September 1980.  Two of the exploratory coreholes,
    EV6-24 which was drilled 81"down to a TD of 302 ft and EV6-29, which
    was drilled 58' up to a TD of 150 ft., were fractured in several zones,
    each using the standard minifrac technique.  Essentially these measure-
    ments were made along the Hole #6 borehole although EV6-29 does deviate
    somewhat to the NW.  The ISIP or minimum principal in situ stress data
    is shown in Figure 37 and Table 6. It can,be seen that there are large
    and quite rapid changes of stresses throughout the 350 ft of section
    studied.  Also, the stress in the densely welded tuff is quite low.
        This distribution of stresses can be explained qualitatively if one
    considers the mesa in its present condition and forgets for the moment
    its geologic history.  Essentially, the mesa consists of tens or even
    hundreds of ash-fall tuff layers of varying thickness and properties
    with two thin, high-modulus, welded tuff strata at widely separated
    locations.  At the present point in geologic time, the layers are stacked,
    well-bonded and predominantly gravity-loaded.  This results in a com-
