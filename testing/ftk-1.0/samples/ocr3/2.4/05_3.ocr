 Fami copes with disease, harassment





2 girls, vulnerable to sunlight, fight genetic, community intolerance

      MERIDIAN, Calif. - The
   Harrison family has been harassed,
   shunned and ridiculed as "vam-
   pires." Their truck was vandalized,
   an antenna atop their house shot
   off, and one of their dogs killed.
      All this because their daughters,
   Jaime, 9, and Sherry, 7, have a
   rare genetic intolerance for the
   sun that leaves its victims vulnera-
   ble to skin cancers, blindness and
   neurological damage.
      The girls spend their days in-
   side a dimly lit house.  Only before
   dawn or after dusk can they ven-
   ture out for typical kid pastimes
   like school, ballet, judo and camp-
   ing.
      "When it gets dark, we go out
   to play," Jaime said.
      Tn the 71/2 years since the dis-
   ease was diagnosed, the family has
   adapted to living in the twilight.



 They wish others would be more
 tolerant.
    "Sometimes it seems that for
 every good person, there's four or
 five bad people," said Jim Harri-
 son, 38, a cabinetmaker and part-
 time judo instructor.
    After experiencing persistent
 harassment while living in Illinois
 and other northern California
 towns, the family   Ifound @ relative
 peace in this tiny Sutter County
 town four years ago.  Meri '
                          ,   idian is
 about 70 miles north of Saciamerl-
 to.
    A television movie     about    the
 Harrisons will bring new attention.
 Kim Harrison, 34, said they are
 willing to trade some privacy to
 help educate others.
    "Children of the Dark," starring
 Peter Horton and Tracy Pollan,
 airs at 9 tonight on Channel 4. "I
 think it would make a lot of dif-
 ference for the movie to come out,
 and more people will know," said
                                       ,I



 Kim Harrison, the girls' mother.
    The Harrison girls have xerod-
 erma pigmentosum, or XP, an of-
 ten-fatal disorder.  Only one in
 about 250,000 people carries the
 gene.  Because the gene is reces-
 sive, both parents have to carry it
 for the disorder to be passed on.
 Even then the chances are one in
 four of having a child with XP.
    It is not contagious.  The girls'
 16-year-old half-brother, Bobby,
 does not have the disorder.
    Growing up in Aurora, Ill.,
 Jaime showed symptoms early.  Ba-
 by pictures show her screwing her
 eyes shut and turning her head
 from the sun.  Her skin burned
 badly, though usually not for 24 to
 48 hours after exposure.
    Doctors initially thought she
 had a rash or allergies.
    On a camping trip in 1986,
 Jaime became seriously ill and had
 to be hospitalized.  Photos show
 her skin a mass of blisters.  Her
 eyes were swollen shut.  Her mouth
 was so cracked and raw she
 couldn't drink from her bottle.
    A skin biopsy revealed XP.
 Doctors said she would likely die
 at an early age from melanoma
 cancer.
  @ Sherry was tested a short time
 later; the results were the same.
    "As far as giving it to the kids,
 we felt really bad about ourselves
 for a long time. . . . We felt very
 defective," Mrs. Harrison said.
 "We've learned a lot since then.
 We understand that all kinds of
 people have gone through things
 like this."
    Mrs. Harrison has started an in-
 formal network for people with
 XP. She has heard from about 25



 healthy.

   They attend school three days a
 week.  Teachers cover the windows
 when the girls are there.  The sis-
 ters also study at home.

   Jaime said she doesn't mind
 staying indoors.  But Sherry, who
 has never been exposed to direct
 sunlight, sometimes chafes under
 the restriction.

   The Harrison house overflows
 with toys and animals.  One room
 looks like an indoor playground
 with a giant inner tube, climbing
 bars and a small pool filled with
 plastic balls instead of water.

   "They're doing well medically.
 They're doing well socially.  They're
 doing well in school," Mrs. Harri-
 son said.  "I think we've proved a
 point.  And that's not what we set
 out to do.  We wanted to save our
 children."
