   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. - The Con-
 f4,-derate battle flag that flies over
 @,YQung Circle here is once again
 cawing a flutter.
   A group of workers from the
 city's Sanitation Department want
 !the, flag taken down because it's
 n9ensive, they say.
   Led by employee Michael Towns,



  File sanitation workers sent a letter
    ting city officials to remove the
  ,Aag.
     "That flag means exploitation
  land injustice," said Mr. Towns, 33.
  "Ma person wants to put the flag on
  his car, house or boat, that's their
  problem.  But I don't think a city
  should be displaying it.  I'd like to
  know why this city is still holding
    to that flag."

   " Guithele Ruiz, director of the Of-
  Ce of Equal Opportunity and Affir-
  mative Action for Hollywood, said
  that Mr. Towns' request will be ad-



 dressed at a special meeting
 Wednesday.
    "We've had a growing number of.
 people express concerns about the
 flag in the past few weeks," Mr. Ruiz
 said.  "We hope this meeting will
 bring a resolution."

    Mr. Ruiz said that members of
 the city's African American Adviso-
 ry Council will also be at the meet-
 ing so they can make a recommen-
 dation to the City Commission on
 the issue.  Commissioners have the
 final say on the flag's fate.
    Mayor Mara Giulianti said she
 would support removing the flag.
    The flag was hoisted in April
 1990 over Young Circle on the re-
 quest of veteran Bill Locke of Holly-
 wood.
    The flag was removed from the
 park in January 1990 after city offi-
 cials were bombarded with com-
 plaints that it was a racist symbol.

    Mr. Locke, who could not be
 reached for comment, persuaded
 commissioners to raise the flag be-
 cause of its historic value.  The
 flag's 13 stars mark the secession of
 11 Southern states - including
 Florida - from the United States in
 1860 and 1861, as well as the seces-
 sion of governments in Kentucky
 and Missouri.
    Mr. Towns credits his 82-year-old
 grandmother for stirring up the is-
 sue again.
    "I had parked at Young Circle
 recently and left my grandma in
 the car while I went across the



 street to a store," Mr. Towns said.
 "When I came back, Grandma was
 apset.  She pointed to the rebel flag
 and told me it reminded her of her
 father's death in Georgia in 1913 at
 the hands of four men who had
 draped the rebel flag across their
 wagon."
   Mr. Towns said his grandmoth-
 er's story moved him to write the
 letter to the city.  He was backed by



several black employees in the
city's Sanitation Department, as
well as part-time city employee Ken-
neth Walton, a recreation leader at
Washington Park.
   "This is terrible," Mr. Walton
said, referring to the flag.  "That
flag is an insult to all black people."
