 Determination of the Zquation for Silica
 14ass Transfer in Rainier Mesa

        Experiment 3 established that the rate of mass trans-

 fer of the constituents from Rainier Mesa glass is dependent

 on the reactive surface area to water volume ratio, a, in

 addition to temperature.  The average total surface area of

 the glass samples use4 to determine the kinetic rate was

 93.6 square meters.  If this-value, along with the rate

 constant obtained for the temperature of the rock and the

 value of b given in Table 4 are used in equation 8, the

 equation of mass transfer of silica into the groundwater of
 Rainier Mesa is obtained:

        If Rainier Mesa precipitation is assumed void of all

 silica (Freeze and Cherryt 1979) 00 equals 0.0, and equa-

 tion 16 becomes:
