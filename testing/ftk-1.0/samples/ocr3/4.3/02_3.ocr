  R)   Retention factors

       The variation of    the retention factors with distance is
       expressed in analytic form R - G+H - 2Sh)
                                             it
       where the constants are given in the tables below for the
       two sets of retention factors for which calculations have
       been made.

 Case-4-a

 This case is based on the basic set of parameter values from
 case I but with a lateral dispersion added.
