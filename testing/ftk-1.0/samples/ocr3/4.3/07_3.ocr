 SLIDE,[master,slave,cfl,cf2,cf3]

     This card specifies the master/slave connection for any slidelines in
 the analysis.  A maximum of 12 slidelines is allowed.

 master-   Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline master side
 slave-    Number of the boundary flag i.d. for the slideline slave side
 efl-      Value of the friction coefficient. if fully fixed use -1.
           Otherwise insert the proper value here. jo.t
 cf2-      Value of slideline overlap tolerance to determine when contact of
           surfaces does occur.127. of the Master element side length(
 cf3-      Value of stress for release of slave node from master surface.
           Value is set to no release,a non-zero value is required to activate
           this option.  JO.J
