    4  Since the parts of the Permian Basin in western Kansas and Texas and in
    eastern Colorado and Now Mexico had been screened as part of an 4arlier site
    evaluation for the waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), this screening focused
    on five 9,,hh-sins: the Anadarko, Palo Duro.  Dalhart.  Midland. and Delaware
    Basins.  All contain salt beds of adequate thickness and depth.  A site had
    already previously been selected in the Delaware Basin as a site for the WIPP
    facility for the storage of radioactive defense wastes (DOZ. 1980b).  The Palo
    Duro and the Delbert Basins had far less potential for oil and gas production
    and have not been penetrated as extensively by drilling as have the Anadarko
    and trio Midland Basins.  Therefore. the Palo Duro and the Delbert Basins were
    judged to be preferable to the other three and were recommended for further
    studies at the area stag* (ONWI, 1983b).  These two basins rated higher on six
    major screening factors: the depth and thickness of salt. seismicity. known
    oil and gas deposits, the presence of exploratory boreholes. and evidence of
    salt dissolution.4

       More-detailed geologic and environmental studies of the Palo Duro and the
    Dalhart Basins began in 1977, and scroonLaq criteria were developed to define
    locations with favorable characteristics.  Six lo-cations in parts of Deaf
    Smith.  Swisher.  Oldham.  Briscoe.  Armstrong, Randall. and Patter Counties,
    Texas, met the screening criteria.  A second set of criteria -as then applied
    to further differentiate among the six locations.  Theme criteria reflected
    siting factors related to goomorpholoqy, the presence of natural resources.
    flexibility in repository siting at specific locations. the number of
    boreholes at each location. population density. and land-us* conflicts.  After
    applying these criteria. the DOZ decided to focus on the two Locations that
    had the greatest likelihood of containing a suitable site. one in northwestern
    Deaf South and southeastern Oldham Counties and one in northcentral Swisher
    County.  All other locations in the Palo Duro Basin were deferred from further
    consideration (ONIFI. 1983a).  In February 19A3. the DOE Ldentified parts of
    Deaf Smith County and Swisher County as potentially acceptable sites and
    subsequently narrow" the size of the two sites to be considered at eacn
    location (DOE. 1984c).4
