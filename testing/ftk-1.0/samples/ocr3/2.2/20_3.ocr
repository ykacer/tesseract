              CLOVERDALE (Black Springs, Golden, Republic)
    The Cloverdale district includes the southern@j';flart of the Sho-
  shone Mountains from the Cloverdale Ranch at the southern tip
  to about 8 miles north, including both East anti West Golden.  The
  district also includes the area near the Orizaba mine, which is on
  a spur off the northern Cedar Mountains and is about 5 miles air
  line southwest of the Cloverdale Ranch.
    The district is about 40 miles by road from either Tonopah or
  Mina. (condition of the routes depends off the part of the district;
  from East Golden and Cloverdale the rotite to Tonopah is usually
  preferred, while from the Orizaba section the Mina road is ordi-
  narily in better condition.  Water may be obtained from several
  springs in the area usually within a short distance of the prop-
  erties.  The California Electric Company's line to Gabbs passes
  between the Cloverdale Itanch and the Orizaba mine and is there-
  fore within a short distance of the mining properties.
