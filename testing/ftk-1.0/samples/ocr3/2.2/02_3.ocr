  ing asperities from the surrounding blocks.  The
  relevant value of JRC can be obtained from:



  where

     T, = tangential component of the self-weight of the
           overlying block (for inclined joint planes)
     T2 =  external pulling force (or pushing force if
           applied via a flat jack inserted between the
           line-drilled walls of two adjacent blocks
           'push' test)
     N = normal component of block weight (W)
      A = joint area

    Equation (2) can then be used to predict the complete
  peak shear strength envelope over the desired level of
  normal stress.
    It is important to note that in estimating JRC from
  equations (3) or (5) the input values for JCS and 0,
  need not be very accurate.  Since the ratio of JCS/u,,
  would probably be in the range of 1000-100,000 in
  most conceivable cases, the error in the estimate of 0,
  would be reduced by a factor of 3-5.  Also, the error in
  estimating the full-scale value of JCS would be rela-
  tively small due to the logarithmic formulation.  In each
  case, equations (3) or (5) ensure an automatic compen-
  sation for overestimates or underestimates of 0, and/or
  JCS by producing underestimated or overestimated
  values for JRC, since the three components combined
  (JRC, JCS, 4),) have to constitute the measured
  strength.  The errors in the values of peak arctan (-r/aJ'
  predicted at the required engineering levels of normal
  stress (aJ would be relatively small (e.g. [12]).

  Correction of JRC values measured on laboratory
  samples
    It may not always be possible to conduct large-scale
  (natural block size) tilt, push or pull tests.  A method is
  needed to extrapolate laboratory JRC values to longer
