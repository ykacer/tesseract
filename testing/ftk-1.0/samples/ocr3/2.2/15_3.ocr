  Dear Sir(s):



                                     I                          I                  I
         I am preparing a D.EA (Diplome d'Etudes Aprofondies) in the University of
  Paris IX - Dauphine, which corresponds to a Master of Science, The subject is the
  application ot the Artificial Intelligence to the entreprises.

         At the actual stage of my research, I am studing the most important Expert
  Systems developped in the area of strategic business planning and management,
  and theoric studies  on that sub'ect. I'm interested too on the Distributed Artificial
  Intelligence and the multi--ogents systems.  I understand that the Institute for
  Information Sciences has been doing research on the Expert Systems oriented to
  the decision process.

         It will be very usefull for me to have access to documents such os
  university papers, articles, and others.  Then, I will be able to compore the work that
  has been done in the Institute for Information Sciences with the research in that
  domain in which we ore working here in Paris.  It you will be so kind to send me
  those documents, please keep me informed about the related expenses.

         If I can be usefull anyway, meaning the exchange of inforrnotion of scientific
  nature, between the institute for Information Sciences and the Paris University,
  please don't hesitate to contact me.



 Sincerely,
