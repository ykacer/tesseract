  communication from its remote location, prearrangi'd short wave
  radio contact was made with Fallon, 80 miles distant 4y road.
  When the ore was Exhausted] in 1940, the operation was shut
  down and all surface plant subsequently sold.  Only the shaft,
  stopes caved to the surface, and the tailing pile remain as evi-
  dence of past activity.
    The Penelas ore occurred in two veins, both in andesite and
  rhyolite, having an average width of about 5 feet.  Mining was
  done on nine levels spaced 100 feet apart with about 4,000 feet of
  laterals.  The 6th, 7th and 8th levels are said to have been the
  most productive, the main ore shoot having been ibout 150 feet
  long.  As stated by L. 1).  Gordon, no values were found below the
  900-foot level.
    The Ole Peterson minor. operated by Peterson in 1936 as the
  Colden Eagle, is the southern find more important retained part
  of several adjoining properties purchased in 1915 by the Kansas
  City-Nevada Consolidated Mines Company.  It is situated along
  the crest of the north end of the Paradise Range about 15 miles
  northwest of )one.  The Penelas adjoins this property on the
  southeast.  The present owner is Mrs. Esther Peterson of Super-
  ior, Wisconsin.  The mine was last leased to John Chisholm and
  George Erwin who made periodic shipments of gold ore in 1938.
    At the Paymaster claim on the north end of thSgro'up the ore
  occurs in a poorly defined zone along a rhyolite-andesite contact.
  An excellent one and one-half compartment 375-foot shaft, with
  levels each 125 feet and about 2,000 feet of laterals, was sunk prior
  to 1920.  Except for the collar set, the timbers show no signs of
  decay and the ladders are in good condition.  It is reported that
  the principal values were found above the 125-foot level and that
  careful selective mining was necessary.  A 50-ton cyanide mill,
  built in 1919 and destroyed by fire a few years later, was appar-
  ently unjustified as no recorded production is shown for the com-
  pany.  Broken Hills, 12 miles west, was probably the principal
  source of ore for the mill.  Little or no work has been done on the
  Paymaster since about 1923.
    The July Lode, at the south end, is the only part of the property
  having an appreciable production.  It is from here that Ole Peter-
  son and leasers are said to have produced about $70,000 in the
  years 1936 to 1944.  The ore occurence here is different from the
  Paymaster in that quartz is more abundant and the ratio of gold
  to si-Wer is much greater.  The values are found in a brecciated
  rhyolite recemented with quartz and occurring'In a chimney-like
  ore shoot approximately 14 feet by 8 feet in c+s-section which
