  Nitrogen Dioxide and Dinitrogen Tetroxide                263



 is reversible at approximately 400'.  It appears that certain nitrites are not affected
 by liquid dinitrogen tciroxide,1- and that the oxidation to nitrate which occurs at
 high temperature is in fact due to atomic oxygen produced by collision of the nitrogen
 dioxide molecules %\ith the surface of the nitrite, yielding nitric oxide at the same
 time.  Anv nitrite Ahich decomposes may appear tu rcact, o\@ing to the reaction of
 the products of the c1ccomposition. 102
   The induced decomposition of hyponitrites has been reported to take place at O'
 In the presence of nitrogen dioxide.1112 The reactions that occur are those found in
 the thermal decomposition of hyponitrites:



  These results appear to be quite different from those of Addison, Gamlen and
  Thorripson'01 .\ho find that unlike nitrite and nitrate, hyponitrite and oxyhypo-
  nitrite ( N,,i-N,O,) are immediately oxidized by liq,,iid nitrogen dioxide.
   The e\plosive decomposition of trieth\lammonium nitrate and nitrogen dioxide
  mixtures has been mcritioned I" and the reaction cf sodamide with nitrogen dioxide
  in carbon tetrachloride solution has been shown to result in the production of the
  amidonitrate."I

                       ne Action of Nitrogen Dioxide on Metals

    Nitrogen dioxide readily attacks many metals and several papers describing such
  reactions are of a technical nature.  Earlier work indicated that nitrogen dioxide
  attacks iron an   j2Uer,  106. 10' and it %%as later suggested""' that in the case of
  @n-@@@nrod Jt 777F oxide, Cu2O.  With mercury the products of reaction were
  thought to be mercurous nitrite 77Mrcuric nitrite.154 Recently 109 the reaction has
  been shown to be represented by the equation:



 The reaction of selenium %%ith gaseous nitrogen dioxide produces seleniumdioxide."'
 The interaction of nitrogen dioxide with atomic sodium results in a powerful chemi-
 luminescence'-'-' Ahich has been attributed to the follo%%ing scheme"-:



     Frequently the reaction of nitrogen dioxide in the liquid phase with a metal results
    in the formation of an adherent film which slows down any subsequent reaction.
    This is apparently not so with zinc and hence the reaction with this element has been
    thoroughly examined.  The alkali metals react rapidly and controllably with liquid
    dinitrogen tetroxide to yield the corresponding nitrates but no nitrite." Zinc reacts
    readily with nitrogen dioxide to give a white co-stalline solid, insoluble in nitrogen
    dioxide, and having the formula Zn(N;O3)2,2N   '_O,.113 At 100' the pure anhydrous
    nitrate is formed. The kinetics of this reaction have been examined"'      as has the
    effect of the addition of dinitrogen trioxide or Pitrosyl chloride.  In the former case
    no additional compounds are formed, although the rate of reaction is increased."'
    With nitrosvl chloride, depending on the conditions of reaction, it is possible to
    obtain the chloride or the nitrate, sometimes solvated.1111
      Solutions of diethyinitrosaminc in dinitrogcii tetroxide behave in a manr.-,- that
    may be interpreted in ternis of the follo@%ing cquilibrial":



    Zinc reacts with these solutions to yield a r@-,d liquid, immiscible %%ith nitrogen
    dio\ldc,l la vhich is the same as the solution obtained by dissolving Zn(\'Oj)-'2\'-04
