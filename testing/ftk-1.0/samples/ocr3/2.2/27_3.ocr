 the conglomerate progressively bevels the Aztec Sandstone, the Chinle For-
 mation, and the Moenkopi Formation.  Thick wedges of coarse conglom-
 erate higher in the formation show by northward thinning and decreasing
 coarseness that an important source was in an area to the south where vol-
 canic rocks and related intrusive bodies now form the chief outcrops.

     Above the basal conglomerate the Thumb Formation consists of reddish
 .sandstone and siltstone, conglomerate, fresh-water limestone, gypsum, and
 thin-bedded flagstone, with a total thickness Of 2,000 to 3,000 feet.  Basalt
 flows and tuffaceous beds are included locally.  Numerous large lenses of
 breccia, made up of Precambrian gneiss, schist, and granite, are seen at many
 horizons of the section; these lenses are as much as 300 feet thick, and some
 are more than half a mile long.  Probably they represent landsliding from
 growing scarps south and east of the basin of deposition (Longwell, I95I,
 P. 352).  Toward the northeast, outcrops of the formation are interrupted
 by a cover of younger deposits.

     Nothing analogous to the Overton Fanglomerate occurs in association
 with the Thumb Formation.

     Overton Fanglomerate.       The Overton Fanglomerate as originally de-
  Fred (Longwell, I92I, P. 52)  included the Willow Tank and Base ine For-
 Nations.  Later (Longwell, 1949, P- 930, these formations were given sepa-
 rate status and the name Overton Fanglomerate was restricted to the thick
 section of coarse deposits resting unconformably on the Baseline Sandstone
 and older formations.  The redefined Overton, made up largely of carbon-
 ate fragments derived from Paleozoic formations, has crude bedding in
 which large blocks, many of them tens of feet long, have disordered arrange-
 ment.  It is steeply tilted to the east and has been bevelled by erosion through
 its entire thickness, which at a maximum exceeds 2,000 feet.  Apparently this
 coarse debris accumulated as coalescent fans in front of an advancing thrust
 sheet, which moved eastward across a strongly folded belt.

     Southwest of Logandale the basal part of the formation, with average
 thickness about ioo feet, consists of conglomerate made up of stream-worn
 pcbbles and cobbles.  This deposit grades upward into sandstone and silt-
 stone, tan-colored and greenish, which locally contains small shells of gastro-
 pods and fragments of fossil wood.  This unit, more than 200 feet thick,
 grades upward into a similar thickness of stream-laid gravel, which in turn
 grades into coarse fan deposits as much as I,500 feet thick.  East of Glendale
 these deposits enclose a mass of Kalbab Limestone more than half a mile
 long and fully a quarter of a mile from a possible source in bedrock.  West
 of Logandale an intact block of Mississippian limestone about i,8oo feet long,
