   dispersed joints have been modeled [Snolv,
   1965], a few examples of which are shown here
   in stercograhic projections.  Systems of any
   desired complexity can be generated by com-
   bining individual dispersions differiiw in direc-
   tion of central tendency, dispersion coeflicierit,
   or SpaCiog.  Plate I shows the change of aniso-
   tropy for a single set having a given dispersion
   'IS the sample
                  size changes.  PInte 2 shows the
   effect of decreasing orientation dispersion from
   F isher's Kr = 6 to 60.  Plate 3 treats two ortho-
   gonal sets, Plate 4 two nonorthogiliml sets, and
   Plate 5 three ortho-onal sets.
    In any one mo5cl, spacin@ has been main-
   tained by proporti(nlill@ the sample size of each
   set accordmg to equation 26 and Figure 5.
    Also displayed in stereographic projection are
   the principal permeability axes for 49 sampl-
   ir)@S, disclosing the range of possible solutions.
    '@liogoiial triplets of 'diamonds, circles, and
   Or
   crosses correspond to maximum, intermediate,
   and minimum permeability axes.  Tile scatter
   simulates the variation in principal permeability
   axes that must exist from one place to another
   in jointed rock.  The axes close on mean dirce-
   tions as the sample size or volume increases.
   Dispersion of the axes would be concealed by
   mean values, using only large samples.  Note
   that aberrant axial orientations are possible
   from a raDdorn model, as illustrated in Plate 1,
   Figure 3, by the minor axis (cross) oriented
   N 78'W, 30' from the vertical.  If a sample
   contains one large opening it will dominate the
   directional permeability just as in open fault
   will dominate the flow in a region.
     Distribution curves of principal pernicabili-
   ties are plotted.  Diamonds, circles, aml crosses
   maintain correspondence of principal axes and
   permeabilitics.  Since tile maximum, interme-
   diate, and minimum perineabififies were ranked
   separately for cuniulatve plotting, the three
   -,values found at any oi)e ordinate (to not con-
   stitute a particular solution.  To preserve in-
   dividual relationships, on the right of the
   permeability plots the cumulative distribution
   of maximum anisotropies has been plotted, each
   being the ratio of minimum permeability to
   maximum permeability for a particular solu-
   tion.
     The dispersion of principal pernicabilities is
   portrayed in Plate 1. The large dispersions coin-
   puted are consistent with the large observed

  variable aperture.  Tile dispersions of principal
  axes (Plate 1, Figures 3 and 5) and pernie-
  abilities (Plate 1, Figures 4 aml 6) decrease
  for samples of increasing size (100 ,aid 600
  joints, respectively), as anticipated from the
  central limit theorem.  Principal axes are con-
  centrated within about 10' in([ 5' of are for
  tile 100 and 500 conduit samples, rcspec-
  tively.  Median permeability values increase
  silently with sample size as shown in the sum-
  mary plot (Figure 2).  Studies naive indicated
  that model permeability is well-defined for 100
  or more joints; otherwise it is a function of size.
    The stercographic projections of principal
  axes display three of the quantities required to
  define a second rank tenser, and the cumulative
  pernicability plots display the other three.  Thus
  each pair of plots should be read together.  Cer-
  tain mutual relationships are evident.  If two
  principal permeabilitics are nearly tile same
  each time a sninple is taken, then their axial
  orientations are sensitive to differences in the
  conductors in the samples.  Since any two equal
  orthogonal permeability vectors define a plane
  of isotropy, we find that Successive solutions for
  a single set of disposed joint orientations scatter
  orientations throughout a great circle of the
  sterconet, such as the equatorial planes of Fig-
  ores 3 and 5 of Plate 1. The normal to the brute
  of isotropy is the only unique principal axis, as
  is tile optie axis of a uninxial mineral. figures
  4 full 6 of ]']at(,.  I show slight differences be-
  tween principal perineabifitics oil the isotropic
  plane (minimum and intermediate pernicabili-
  ties), whereas the intermingling of dianionds
  and circles oil the girdle in the stereognuil indi-
  cates statistical isotropy, especially for large
  samples.
    Sheeted granite is a protOtYPO of a single
  set of joints.  PInte 2 illustrates the effect of de-
  creasing orieranfion dispersion of a single set of
  joints.  The joint populations for Fisher's K,
  6 to GO are shown, as well as tile principal Taxes
  and perineabiliti(,s for samples of size 92 to 106,
  varying accordin@ to equation 26 to riiniiitain a
  sample volume of 1035 cm cubed for a jointed
  medium of inverse specific surface 10 cm, As
  orientation dispersion decreases, there is pro-
  gressive reduction of the dispersion of axes aod

    It is rarer to find only two sets of joints in
  rock than to find crib or three sets.  Two ortho-
  gonal joint sets of equal properties are repre-
  sented in Plate 3, Figure 1. Principal axes shown
  in Plate 3, Figure 2, indicate that the central
  tendencies of normals to tNNo sets of orthogonal



  Joints of like properties lie on a plane of near
  i9olropy, even for small samples.  Tile unique
  major axis contains the central plane of each
  set, in other words, lies parallel to the predomi-
  naut direction of intersections.  Permeability in
  the isotropic plane is half the value in the direc-
  tion of the intersection.
    When the two orthogonal sets differ, as in
  Maie 3, Figure 4, three unique axes appear, one
  paHlel to the central normal of each set.  The
