 66                    TIMBER MOUNTAIN-OASIS VALLEY CALDERA COMPLEX, NEVADA



  logically and petrographically from members of the Paint-
  brush Tuff, as now defined, and is more closely related in
  its petrography to the intracaldera tuffs and rhyolites of
  Area 20.  The xenolithic inclusions of intracaldera Grouse
  Canyon and the areal distribution of the Stockade Wash
  indicate a source within the Silent Canyon caldera.  The
  total erupted volume of the Stockade Wash was about
  20-40 kM3 (5-10 Mi3).  Recurrent minor subsidences
  probably occurred within Silent Canyon caldera as the
  thick sequence of tuffs and rhyolites of Area 20
  accumulated inside the caldera, with the result that the
  underlying Crater Flat Tuff was eventually downdropped
  more than 2 km (diagram 2, fig. 26).
    The members of the Paintbrush Tuff and petro-
  logically related alkali-calcic lavas were erupted from the
  Claim Canyon cauldron (diagram 3, fig. 26) resulting in a
  caldera of unknown extent.  Only a small segment of the
  Claim Canyon cauldron is now exposed, but the general
  size and location of the collapse structure can be inferred,
  from distribution of tuffs and lavas north and south of
  Timber Mountain caldera, to be about 25 km (15 mi) in
  diameter and to be centered several kilometres west of the
  present summit of Timber Mountain.  The oldest member
  of the Paintbrush Tuff, the Topopah Spring, was erupted
  about 13 m.y. ago with a total volume of about 250 kM3 (60
  Mi3).  Recurrent subsidence within the cauldron followed
  eruption of the Topopah Spring Member of the Paint-
  brush Tuff, and probably a minor collapse followed the
  eruption of the Pah Canyon and Yucca Mountain
  Members.  Within the caldera they accumulated to several
  times their thickness outside the caldera.  The Tiva
  Canyon Member, representing the climactic eruption in
  the evolution of the Claim Canyon cauldron, flowed out
  about 12.5 m.y. ago mainly to the west of the Claim
  Canyon cauldron.  The tuff of Chocolate Mountain, which
  is about 1,000 in (3,300 ft) thick, was erupted as a late
  quartz latitic phase of the Tiva Canyon and was confined
  within the Claim Canyon cauldron, suggesting that
  collapse was occurring during its eruption, although
  Christiansen and others (1976) infer a collapse to the west
  of the site of Oasis Valley.  Tuff breccia, similar petro-
  graphically to the Tiva Canyon, was generated at vents
  along or near the wall of the Claim Canyon cauldron
  segment.  The volume of the Tiva Canyon, including the
  intracauldron tuff of Chocolate Mountain, may have
  totaled as much as 1,000 km' (250 mil).  The youngest
  separate cooling unit of the Paintbrush, the tuff of Pinyon
  Pass, followed very soon after the Tiva Canyon was
  confined to the newly formed caldera.

     After eruption of the ash-flow sheets of the Paintbrush
  Tuff and after the formation of the caldera, intricate
  faulting occurred within the Paintbrush cauldron, similar
  to that on Timber Mountain.  The fault pattern is inter-
  preted by the present authors (see also Christiansen and



                                            rence with uplift
 others, 1976) as owing to magmatic resurg
 of the cauldron block from its former subsided position
 (diagram 4, fig. 26).  The entire Paintbrush cauldron later
 participated in a broad magmatic doming preliminary to
 the culminating stages of volcanism-the eruption of ash-
 flow sheets of the Timber Mountain Tuff.  Quartz-bearing
 pre-Rainier Mesa rhyolite lavas were extruded from
 fractures probably related to this broad doming (diagram
 5, fig. 26).  Gas-charged silicic rhyolitic magma
 accumulated at the top of the domical chamber, and tuffs
 were assimilated from the roof as crystallization proceeded
 lower in the chamber.
   The Timber Mountain Tuff chapter of the caldera
 complex began 11.3 m.y. ago with eruption of the
 voluminous Rainier Mesa Member from the central part of
 the broad dome that had formed over the magma.chamber.
 The domed roof over the magma chamber ruptured
 sufficiently to cause a considerable reduction of pressure
 and to trigger vesiculation which greatly increased the
 volume of the gas-charged magma escaping through
 fissures.  As the eruption proceeded, collapse of the roof
 occurred, and the Rainier Mesa accumulated to a greater
 thickness inside the subsidence area than outside (diagram
 6, fig. 26).  As the caldera deepened with continuing
 eruption a more crystal-rich, but less gas-charged, quartz
 latitic magma was tapped, whose eruptions were largely
 confined within the caldera.  Poorly sorted debris flows
 containing large blocks of welded tuff and lava slid off the
 newly formed oversteepened caldera walls and inter-
 tongued with the upper quartz latitic part of the Rainier
 Mesa Member.  A total volume of about 1,200 km' (300 mil)
 of tuff had been extruded by this time, and a large volcano-
 tectonic depression formed, including the Timber
 Mountain caldera and probably the adjacent Oasis Valley
 caldera segment.  There is little evidence to indicate
 whether or not there was central resurgent doming of the
 Rainier Mesa Member within this depression, except for
 the westward-tilted block in the Transvaal Hills west of
 Timber Mountain caldera.
   During the brief interval between the eruptions of the
 Rainier Mesa Member and Ammonia Tanks Members of
 the Timber Mountain Tuff (I 1.3-1 1.1 m.y.), pre-
 Ammonia Tanks rhyolite lavas were extruded within the
 caldera that had resulted from the Rainier Mesa eruptions
 (diagram 7, fig. 26).

   The Ammonia Tanks Member of the Timber Mountain
 Tuff was erupted 11.1 m.y. ago.  Nearly half its total
 volume of 900 km' (230 Mi3) probably accumulated within
 a concomitantly subsiding caldera, as evidenced by the fact
 that no debris flows or breccias are known to intertongue
 with the tuff.  This episode of cauldron subsidence of
 Timber Mountain caldera occurred within an area some-
 what smaller than the Rainier Mesa collapse area
 (diagram 7, fig. 26) and was centered farther south, with
