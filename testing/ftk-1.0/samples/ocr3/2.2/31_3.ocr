   where i and i are unit vectors in the x- and v-directions,

   extra atomic plane forming the dislocation.
      Edge dislocations move easily only in their slip @or
   glide) plane.  Motion perpendicular to the slip plane bN
   ctimb requires transport of vacancies or interstitiais to or
   from the bulk of the solid to the dislocation line lzi@
   diffusion.  Point defect migration under most conditions is
   .,low because the concentrations of vacancies or interstitials
   is quite low.  However. at temperatures above roughl%
   one-half the melting point I- K) or in a radiation field,
   @uffiicient point defects are present and their mobility is
   great enough to permit edge dislocation climb to take place
   at measurable rates.  The climb process is of primary
   importance in the slow plastic deformation mechanism
   known as creep. which profoundly affects the performance
   of reactor fuel elements.
       The force causing climb is not restricted to external
   stresses applied to the solid, as shown in Fig. 8.10b. The
   internal stress due to the presence of other nearby
   dislocations or to the creation of high point defect
   supersaturation bv radiation can also induce climb of the
   edge portions of dislocations i Chap. 16, See. 16.7).
       A ;imilar analysis can be applied to a screw dislocation.
   Figure 8.11 shows a screw dislocation of length S which
   experiences a force per unit length F in the slip direction
   due to an applied shear stress cr,.,. The subscripts on the
   -hear stress indicate that it acts in the slip plane iwhich is
   perpendicular to the v-axisl and in the direction of the



z-axis.  Note that in this case the force on the dislocation
line is at right angles to the direction of the applied stress
that produces the force.  If the screw dislocation moves a
distance \x in the x direction. an area S \x slips by
a distance b in the slip direction i the z-direction i. The work
done by the applied stress is ((j,.,S \x)b.  Equating this
quarititv of xork to a force on the dislocation line acting in
the x-direction times the distance the line mo@ps, we find
the force on a unit length of screw dislocation produced b@
the shear stress to be



  As in the case of stresses acting on edge dislocations. choice
  of - or - in Eq. 8. 14 depends on the sign of the dislocation
  (i.e., whether the screw is left-handed or right-handed).
      The dependence of the direction of the force exerted
  bv a shear   stress on the sign of both edge and screw
  dislocations implies that the dislocation loop shown in
  Fig. 8.6 can be made to expand uniformly in the radial
  direction bv  a shear force in the direction of the arrow in
  the drawing.  The x-direction force exerted on the edge
  component at A is -(jx,b, and the edge component at C is
  subject to a force -(j,,b.  Similarly, the v-direction forces
  on the screw components at B and D are -(j,,.b and -r;,,.b,
  respectively .
      Tensile or compressive stresses produce no force on a
  screw dislocation. which is incapable of movement by
  climb.

  8.5.1 Densitv of Dislocation Lines

      The concentration of dislocation lines in a solid is
  measured b%, the number of dislocation lines that penetrate
  a unit area within the crvstal.  This quantity. which is
  known as the dislocation densitv, ranges from            _ 104
  dislocations cm" in high-purity carefully. prepared semicon-
