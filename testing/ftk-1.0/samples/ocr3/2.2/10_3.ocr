 NEVADA OLL SHALE

     Nevada oil shale was first recognized at Elko in 1875 by R. M. Catlin
 (Russell, 1980, p. 75), and there were some attempts at about that same time
 (before the character of oil shales was recognized) to utilize some of the
 darker shales as coal for the railroad (Winchester, 1923, p. 101).  The Elko
 oil shale,3 were described in the early geological reports on the area by the
 U.S. Geological Survey.  Although he did not refer to the rocks as oil shale,
 Clarence King (1878, p. 312) described brown carbonaceous beds north of Elko as
 if containing a high proportion of volatile hydrocarbons burning when heated with
 an intensely blue flame
     The term oil shale was first used in the Nevada geologic literature by
 Schrader and others (1916), who reported oil shale outcrops near Elko and at
 Hamilton west of Ely.  Lincoln (1923) briefly mentioned five other Nevada
 localities.  Several of these localities have had no further geologic investi-
 gation to date (for example, the locations queried on fig. 1).
     The Catlin Shale Products Company plant at Elko, operated intermittently
 between 1917 and 1924, was the best technically oriented and best financed
 effort to develop western U.S. oil shales during this period (Russell, 1980,
 p. 75).  Although over 12,000 barrels of shale oil were probably produced,
 the plant was a commercial failure and the shale oil products were generally of
 poor quality.  The Catlin operation was a pioneer effort in the U.S. to develop
 methods to produce shale oil for competition with petroleum products (Russell,
 1980, p. 75).
      Except for the Elko shales, no other attempts have been made to exploit
 any of the State's scattered oil shales.  Although several oil shale localities
 in Nevada have been known for some time, only recently have investigators begun
