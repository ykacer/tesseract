 HY 2                     WATER USE                       75



   1963 (see Table 2) and is not included in the consumptive use shown.  Water
   added to the tanks was adjusted for changes in soil moisture during the month,
   The depth to water was held between 5 and 6 ft below land surface.
     As a result of the general increase of vegetation in each of the tanks,
   water use during 1964 greatly exceeded that used during 1963.  The pattern of
   vegetation development was not the same for each tank, however, so the rela-
   tion between data for pairs of individual tanks was continually changing.  In
   1965, the plants were approaching maturity, and the volume of vegetation
   increased only slightly.
     A search of the literature indicated that water-use data for arrowweed
   were lacking prior to the current studies at Yuma.  The data now available
   indicate that under favorable conditions, arrowweed will use as much water
   as saltcedar, which has long beenknownforits high rate of water use.
     Saltbush-Quailbrush (Atriplex lentiforinis) was grown in tanks I and 2.
   and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) was grown in tank 3. The salt-
   bush was established both by transplanting and seeding.  Depth to water was
   held at 3 to 4 ft below land surface, in 1962, and nearly constant at 5.5 ft
   during 1963 and 1964.
     The quailbrush made most of its growth during 1963, the average volume
   of the two tanks increasing from 1,050 cu ft in December, 1962, to 5,650 cu
   ft in October, 1963.  Although the average volume of vegetation increased to
   6,240 cu ft by September, 1964, and 7,030 by August 6, 1965, the volume of
   foliage actively transpiring may have been less (see Fig. 3).  Growth in tank
   1 was more vigorous than in tank 2 during 1964.  The consuniptive use, shown
   in Table 8, does not include precipitation but is adjusted for soil-ilioisture
   changes during the month.
      Four-wing saltbush, grown in tank 3, is smaller and slower in grow-th than
   quailbrush.  This plant will exist as a xerophyte, but appears to grow and pro-
   duce seed only when moisture is sufficient to rueet minimum needs.  The
   greatest growth of vegetation in the tank was made during 1963, when the
   volume increased from 1,290 to 2,290 cu ft.  The volume was 2,770 cu ft oil
   September 24, 1964, and 3,080 on August 6, 1965.  The water use, shown in
   Table 8 and Fig. 4, was significantly less during 1964 and 1965, essentially
   because of the maturation of the plants.
      Cattail.-Cattail grows to maturity and dies each season. hi the Yunla
   area, growth begins in March and ends in July; vegetation begins to dies ill
   October and usually is dry by December.  The tanks for cattail were set well
   within an extensive area of similar vegetation.  Cattail transplanted late ill
   the 1961 growing season made little growth during the remainder of tile year.
   During 1962 and following years, however, the cattail grew normally in trick
   tanks, attaining an average height of 6 to 7 ft each year.
      Water was added to the tanks at least twice each week, reestablishing tile
   water level at a point 2 to 4 in, above the roots of the plants.  Water
   changed once each week to prevent the accumulation of salts, Except for, flu,
   vegetation in tank 3 during 1964, as will be explained subsequently, catulil
   in the tanks blended well with that of the surrounding area (see Fig. 5).
      Consumptive use from tank 1 showed no progressive increase or decrepit :c
   during the 3 yr, as indicated by Table 9 and Fig. 6, The appearance of 'Illo
   vegetation was about the same each year.  Tile condition of the vegetation) ;I,
   tank 2 was noticeably improved during 1964 relative to previous yearf@, @1 10
   the higher use from this tank during 1964 is associated with this change.  Tl-
