  g-here tDA represents the dimensionless time based

 The pressure drop on the fracture for a vertical

  The pressure drops on the fracture for a uniform
  flux fracture and for an infinite-conductivity fracture
  are obtained by evaluating Eq. 29 at xf) - 0 and
       0.732, respectively.  The choice of the same
  point as in the infinite case leads to reasonable
  results and can be Justified a posteriori by the
  method of drsuprrpusition, presented later in this
  paper.  Numerical values of the dimensionless
