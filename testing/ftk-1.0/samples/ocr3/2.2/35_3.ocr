 Need for Thermal Analysis

      Many aspects of waste package design and testing depend in part on the
 temperature environment to which the emplaced packages will be exposed.
 Information produced by thermal analysis is needed for the following reasons.

      0   io demonstrate that designs will not exceed maximum temperature
          criteria for Lne Various waste forms: 773 K (5000C) for Defense High
          @evel Waste  DHLW) glass, 673 K (400'r-) for Commercial High Level
          waste (_'HLW) glass, and 623 K (30-O'C) for Spent F@jei SF);

      0   To provide orojected temperature nistories for materials selection;

      0   lo assist in the verification of the performance analysis code, AAPPA


      0   To provide temperature boundary conditions for the performance
          analysis code,

      0   To provide tne temperature environment for transportation, ndnaling,
          storage ano retrieval analyses;

      0   To calculate approximate time periods of steam/waLer contact,with
          waste package;

      0   To provide temperature histories for corrosion testing;

      0   To provide temperature histories for waste form leach testing;

      0   To provide temperature histories and boundary conditions for very
          near field steam/air/water porous flow calculations;



 - (WAPPA is a one-dimensionai code designed to calculate the corrosion and
 leaching of the various waste package components and to calculate the eventual
 Dreacning and the release rate to the repository.  WAPPA consists of five
 proc es s suomode Is inc Iuding the radi ation, therma I, mechanic a l , corrosion all d
 leach submodels).
