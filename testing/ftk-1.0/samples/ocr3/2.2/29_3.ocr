  (Figure 2c), an area of stagnant water is
  formed.  A high accumulation of mineral con-
  stituents is probable at these places.  Below such
  a stagnant body of groundwater, flow occurs
  again and may result in a better quality of
  water than that from shallower depths.
    7. Decreasing potential with depth in re-
  charge areas and increasing potential in dis-
  charge areas are direct consequences of the the-
  ory and call be observed in all diagrams of
  Figure 2. It should be noted, however, that such
  a configuration of the equipotential lilies is pro-
  nounced only in the immediate vicinities of the
  highs and lows.  The midlines and their vicinities
  are locations of relatively straight, vertical cqui-
  potential lilies.
    S. From Figure 2 it call safely be stated that
  the major stream of the basin receives ground-
  water contributions only from the adjacent
  topographic highs and from possible regional
  flow.  The latter is probably unimportant in
  most cases because of the low rate of flow.  It
  is conceivable, then, that the methods in which
  baseflow data are used for computation of basin-
  wide characteristics (average recharge, permea-
  bility, etc.) are misleading or erroncous.  Even



 if the two flanks of a basin are of low relief, @
 that there are no local systems, the bulk of V
 basin discharge will take place between the mik
 line and the valley bottom and only a small por
 tion will appear as baseflow.
    9. A further consequence of the theory
 that the water levels at shallow depths are tf.
 most affected by seasonal recharge and di
 charge.  The small intake and outlet areas of tl@
 intermediate and regional zones prevent d
 water levels from fluctuating widel     ,v. Plotnikc
 and Bogoniolot, [1958, p. 90] make a distin(
 tion between two zones on the basis of fluctm
 tion of the water levels.  They call the first 'zor,
 of oscillations of underground water levels.' Ac
 cording to them the -volume of water that occu
 pics the zone of oscillation undergoes season:
 variations.  This N-ohnne would control groulic
 water discharge and therefore thev call it 'Col
 trol reserves of underground waters.' Their set
 ond zone includes all the water that is below th
 zone of oscillation, both that in the deeper, st.
 homogeneous parts of the basin and that i-
 artesian aquifers; these are the 'secular n-
 sources.' It seems that the 'zonc of oscillatior
