 Hordes of competitors in a commendably schizophrenic array of cars manage
                  once again to somehow achieve the possible.
                                BY STEVEN COLE SMITH



          rock Yates is getting tense.  Just hours
          before the 1993 One Lap of America
   Bis set to flag off, one of the highest-
   profile entries is short a driver.
      Of course, this being the tenth-annual
   One Lap, it would be unprecedented for
   all to go without at least the threat of mild
   calamity.  And this problem is certainly
   minor in comparison to, say, 1985, when
   Ralph Nader threatened to block the start of
   One Lap with a bunch of people in wheel-
   chairs, symbolizing his belief that



driving for enjoyment is somehow sinful.
    Nonetheless, this qualifies as a crisis:
Doug Shepherd, a rally driver and man-
ager for Advanced Chassis Packaging for
Chrysler, was scheduled to drive the
Chrysler-sponsored Dodge Viper.  He
dropped out at the last minute because a
freak storm damaged his house.
    Yates is scrambling to find a replace-
ment when his eyes land on Elliot Forbes-
Robinson, an accomplished road racer
    who just happens to be here because



  he towed one of his neat little Legends
  race cars from North Carolina to
  donate for the auction that would be
  held after the One Lap to benefit the
  Ronald McDonald Children's Chari-
  ties.  Forbes-Robinson is promptly
  enlisted to drive the Viper along with
  Don Jankowski, a vehicle-develop-
  ment engineer on the Viper team,
  Relieved, Yates reverts to his normal
  state of semi-tenseness.
     So at 12:30 a.m. on June 9, a
  Tuesday, the Bridgestone-sponsored
  Car and Driver 1993 One Lap of



 America began its 2800-mile, 89-hour
 round trip at the Race Rock Cafe, a snazzy
 autornotive-theined eatery in the Detroit
 Suburb of Fraser.
    The Race Rock, run by ex-elephant
 trainer Bobby Moore, hasa Newman-Haas
 Indy car suspended from the ceiling, which
 revolves over the bar.  Upside-down.  This
 is oood to know in advance, otherwise you
 are likely to glance up, take one look at
 yourdrink, andplace ancrnergencycall to
 Betty Ford,
    Reoular Leaders know that One Lap
 began in 1984 as a Generally law-abiding,
 8500-rni1c, week-long endurance rally run
 round the country, from Detroit to Detroit
 usually by way of California, Texas, Hand
 Florida.  One Lap is a kinder, gentler evo-
 lution of Yates's not-even-reinotely-legal
 Cannonball Run, which was a mad dash
 from New York to Los Angeles.  Yates dis-
 continued the Cannonball Run in 1979,
 aware that it was just a matter of time
 before a competitor T-boned a bus from Ilic
 Our Lady of Perpetual Motion Rest Home,
 likely resulting in unfavorable publicity.
