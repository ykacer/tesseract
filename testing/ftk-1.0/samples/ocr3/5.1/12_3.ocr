 After being injured in a car crash, a 46-year-old Massachusetts man
 began speaking with a French accent-a victim ofa rare neurological
 disorder, Foreign Accent Syndrome.  The syndrome, usually a result
 of stroke or head trauma, results from damage to an area ofthe brain
 involved in controlling the vocal chords, reports neurologist Majaz
 Moonis ofthe University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worces-
 ter.  Still, much remains mysterious: Why, for example, a French ac-
 cent?  The patient had no French ancestry and the farthest he'd ever
 ventured from his hometown of Worcester was a trip to New Jersey.

Handy Men Although
breast tumors are equally
likely to occur on either side
of the body, left-breast tumors
are detected earlier, accord-
ing to Minneapolis surgeon
Leonard Schultz.  That's be-
cause the tumors are picked
up by the women's husbands,
Dr. Schultz told Physician's
Weekly, "and most men are
right-handed."



Bored to Tears



Every year for the past
eight years something



called the Boring Institute
in Maplewood, N.J., has de-
claredJuly "National Anti-
Boredom Month." This
July the institute highlights
the role of boredom in a
variety of serious health



problems, from eating disorders, alcohol and drug
abuse to suicide.  And what's one of the institute's
main recommendations?  Turn off the TV!  Maybe
this whole Boring Institute idea was d cute gimmick
for a year or two-thrce, tops-but by now it's be-
ginning to seem a little ... well... .
