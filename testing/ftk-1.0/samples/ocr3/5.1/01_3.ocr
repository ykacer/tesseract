 Somatic Effects: Cancer                                           353



    malignant lymphoma has been identified in the followup of infants given
    radiation therapy for thymic enlargements Two new cases were observed
    in the treated infants in the fourth survey (bringing the total to eight, com-
    pared with 3.97 expected).  The highest dose group contained two cases,
    with 0.49 expected.  No increase was observed in the sibling control
    groups.  Thus, from all the evidence reviewed, it seems highly probable
    that malignant lymphoma is increased in children after high levels of
    radiation exposure.  The appearance of increased risk comes later than for
    leukemia and may last longer.

    Multiple Myeloma Since the 1973 study'32 a more extensive study of
    multiple myelomaI2 has identified 22 confirmed cases among survivors in
    the LSS sample: 14 in Hiroshima and eight in Nagasaki.  With the data of
    the two cities pooled for analysis, those exposed to 100+ rads kerma have
    a significantly increased risk relative to that of those exposed to less than I
    rad (relative risk, 4-7).  Excess mortality was estimated at 0.45 death per
    million persons per rad of marrow dose for the mixed neutron and gamma
    radiation. 12

    Summary

    Extensive information has been accumulated on hematologic malignan-
    cies (especially leukemia) after whole-body radiation exposure.  Because of
    the low natural occurrence of leukemia, the high radiosensitivity of stem
    cells, and the short minimal latent period (2-3 yr), leukemia was recog-
    nized early as a potential consequence of high-level radiation exposure in
    man.31 To understand the pathophysiology of these diseases and the
    mechanisms by which radiation exerts its effects, many experimental
    studies have been conducted in a large number of animal strains.  These
    have led to several important conclusions that bear on the interpretation
    of dose-response curves derived from epiderniologic studies in man.  Given
    the body of knowledge derived from controlled animal studies and parallel
    (but uncontrolled) studies in persons exposed to high doses (where
    statistically valid observations can be made), we have been led to fit the
    observed data to models that are consistent with animal and human data.
     Leukemia induction after low doses of IOW-LET radiation in experi-
    mental studies in mammals is curvilinear, with decreasing effectiveness
    per rad at the lowest doses.  Also, a decrease in effect is seen at pro-
    gressively diminished dose rates.  The data indicate that small amounts of
    radiation-induced damage can be repaired to a substantial extent.  Similar
    repair mechanisms are believed to operate in man, inasmuch as they occur
    in so many different organisms.
