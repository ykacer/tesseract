ent shop into a jack-of-all-trades for the
multimedia age.  From the sleek, $16 mil-
lion headquarters that I. M. Pei designed
for him in Beverly Hills, Ovitz offers
his clients advice on everything from
advertising and investment banking to
sports marketing and technology.  CAA'S
100-odd agents run the gamut from Ar-
mani-wearing types to gray-suited num-
ber-crunchers (page 54).
RRM MWD.  Make no mistake: Ovitz still
derives his clout from the big names in
his Filofax.  Michael Jackson, Steven
Spielberg, Kevin Costner, and so on.
Just look at this summer's big movies:



 CAA packaged combinations of stars, di-
 rectors, and writers for Jurassic Park
 and Clifthanger.  It represented many of
 the stars in Dave, Sleepless in Seattle,
 and Dennis the Menace.  And Ovitz res-
 cued The Firm, a project that had all
 but fallen apart last year when CAA
 client Tom Cruise balked at the directors
 Paramount had proposed for the film.
 Along came Ovitz, with client Sydney
 Pollack in tow.  With Pollack at the helm,
 The Firm has generated $115 million in
 ticket sales so far.
   What sets Ovitz apart, though, is his
 dogged push to insinuate himself and
 CAA into realms far beyond mere movie-
 making.  The MGM deal solidifies his sta-
 tus as Hollywood's foremost investment
 banker.  He already advised Sony on its
 $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pic-
 tures and brokered Matsushita's nearly
 $7 billion acquisition of MCA.
   Ovitz can be a powerful force behind
 the scenes, too.  This spring, he offered



shopping tips to Edgar Bronfman Jr., a
longtime friend and president of Joseph
E. Seagram Corp., who was looking to
invest in a media company.  In June,
Bronfinan plunked down more than $700
million for a 5.7% stake inTime Warner
Inc.  Ovitz is also advising Paramount
Communications Corp. on possible deals,
including a joint venture with British
recording giant Thorn EMI PLC that
didn't get off the ground: "He's an op-
portunist," says Paramount Chairman
Martin S. Davis, 'and I mean that in
the finest sense of the word."
   Last year, Ovitz spirited the creative



portion of Coca-Cola Co.'s huge advertis-
ing account away from McCann-Erick-
son Worldwide, the soft-drink giant's
long-time agency.  Now, he is trying to
help Nike Inc. break into sports-event
promotion by producing a Super Bowl
for college football, with six playoff
games, TV specials, and a worldwide sat-
ellite broadcast.  As with everything,
Ovitz views the deal in multimedia
terms: "Entertainment and sports will
be the Trojan horse that brings every-
thing else into the home," he says.
   To close the loop on digital media,
Ovitz is also forging ties with technology
companies that produce multimedia hard-
ware and software.  In recent months,
Ovitz has cultivated such high-tech
heavyweights as Microsoft Chairman
William H. Gates III, Apple Computer
Chairman John Sculley, and Robert M.
Kavner, technology czar at AT&T.
   Ovitz and Gates are nearing an agree-
ment to co-develop interactive TV Coln-



mercials and programs.  CAA would sup-
ply the star power, while Microsoft
would kick in the interactive gadgetry.
"People should think of CAA as more
than just a talent agency," says Gates,
who first met Ovitz 18 months ago in a
Seattle restaurant.  At the time, Ovitz
says Gates wasn't sure why a Holly-
wood agent wanted to link up with a
software creator.  Four hours later, the
two were convinced they should team
up on interactive programming.
   The first details of Ovitz' relationship
with AT&T emerged on July 28, when
Ma Bell said it would buy into an on-line



 service called Sierra Network.
 AT&T plans to broaden the
 network's programming, and
 insiders say Ovitz will line up
 the entertainment.
 TOO THIN?  With such multi-
 layered contacts, rivals ques-
 tion whether Ovitz has grown
 too influential.  They wonder,
 for example, whether Mancu-
 so will be able to rebuff Ovitz
 when the man who helped
 put him atop MGM comes to
 his studio with a pricey deal.
 And others still call Ovitz'
 deal with Cr6dit Lyonnais a
 conflict of interest.  Jeffrey
 Berg, chairman of archrival
 International Creative Man-
 agement, has asked the Jus-
 tice Dept.'s Antitrust Div. to
 investigate the arrangement.
   A more pertinent question
 might be whether Ovitz is
 spreading himself too thin.  He
 insists that he still spends
 75% of his time on client busi-
 ness.  But with his pampered
 clientele, even the appearance



                               0- (
that Ovitz is tending more t rates or
Sculley than Cruise could prove damag-
ing.  As Paramount President Stanley R.
Jaffe, a longtime Ovitz champion, points
out: "In a creative business, when some-
one doesn't get a call back in the 30
minutes he's allotted you, he may start
to look elsewhere." Indeed, icM's Berg
crows that five CAA clients, including
actor James Woods, have left Ovitz'
agency in recent weeks.
   Woods may be no Madonna or Spiel-
berg.  But Ovitz can7t shrug off any client
defections, since he owns little but his
relationships.  What's more, industry ex-
perts say overall revenue in the talent-
agent business has dropped 20% since
1991 as Hollywood battles its costs.  For
his part, Ovitz insists CAA's revenues
are up.  Rivals estimate the agency rakes
in $200 million a year; Ovitz' 55% stake
could net him an estimated $10 million.
Still, CAA draws its power from an
ephemeral network of clients and po-
