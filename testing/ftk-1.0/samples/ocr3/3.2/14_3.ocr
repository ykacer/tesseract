 Figure 189. -Lower surfaces of dead fir leaves from sites I
 and 2 in the seared zone (see fig. 185).  Wax plug (wp) in
 stornatal antechamber pore (ap) seems intact in leaf from
 site I (A), but only wax plug remnants (rm) remain on leaf
 from site 2 (B).  Cuticle of rim (r) of antechamber pore and
 ribbing (rb) appears glazed in leaf from site I (A), and
 outlines of guard cells (gc) are apparent in some stomata
 on leaf from site 2 (B).



 eruption was greater than 50'C, hot enough to result
 in leaf death.  However, volcanic SO, or droplets of
 H,SO. may also have played a role in causing leaf
 death.  Site 1 was closer to the volcanic crater, was
 higher in elevation, and was subjected to tempera-
 tures nearly 2000C cooler than site 2. Although hot
 ejecta were deposited on site 1, this site was at the
 southern margin of the eruption cloud and it is in-
 ferred from this study that the air temperatures re-
 mained relatively cool.  Site 2 was 2,400 m lower in
 elevation than the crater and 21 km away, but it was
 in one main path of the directed blast.  The higher air
 temperatures at site 2 may have resulted from heated
 air, which was trapped and carried between hot ash
 particles that were falling and flowing downhill.
 Analyses of leaves from additional sites (fig. 185) may
 provide further insight into the temperature patterns
 in the seared zone of the blast area.  These estimates
 would be of geological interest and could reveal pat-
 terns of heat dispersion from the eruption of May 18,
 1980.
