                                2. GEOENGINEERING

       In this chapter, the mechanical, thermal, and.thermomechanical properties
  of the rock units and the expected parameter ranges that are the basis for the
  conceptual design of the geologic repository should be presented.  Each dis-
  cussion should include a brief summary of generic information from similar
  rock units and projects and site-specific information,* if available.  The
  information should be in sufficient detail to (1) permit an understanding
  of the geomechanical basis of the proposed-conceptual design of a repository
  appropriate to the site (Chapter 6) and (2) support the discussion of design
  issues in Part B. The discussions should include values or ranges of values
  for the design parameters used in the conceptual design and should provide the
  rationale for selecting these preliminary values.

       For each of the properties of the rock units, include a discussion of the
  equipment and procedures used, including their limitations and the errors
  produced by them. (Equipment and procedures should be referenced to the appro-
  priate standards, e.g., ASTM, where available.) Geologic borehole logs, geologic
  cross sections, or photographs accumulated during preliminary site exploration
  activities should be provided when possible to show where tests were conducted
  or samples were taken.  Any measures taken to preserve or restore the in situ
  chemical and physical environment during site exploration should be described.
  The anisotropy of the properties should be addressed.  If isotropic approxima-
  tions are assumed, justify that assumption.

               2.1 Mechanical Properties of Rock Units - Continua

       Present the mechanical properties of the rock units as determined by labo-
  ratory tests on intact samples of the potential host rock and of other rock
  units important for the conceptual design of a repository appropriate to the
  site and its performance if available.  Also present available generic data
  from similar rock units.  Include site-specific information, when available, on
  elastic and inelastic behavior, time-dependent deformation characteristics,
  compressive and tensile strength, and effects of heating and fluid pressure on
  these properties.

             2.2 Mechanical Properties of Rock Units - Large Scale

       Present the results of any large-scale laboratory and field tests such as
  plate-bearing tests, chamber tests, flat jacks, Goodman jacks, and convergence
  tests. ("Large-scale" here means tests of sufficient size to take into account
  the discontinue (fractures, joints, inhomogeneities, etc.) of the media.)
  Discuss the relationship of the results of the laboratory tests on intact samples
  to the results of the large-scale tests.  Provide site-specific data, if avail-
  able, as well as available generic data for similar rock units and environments.



 *Site-specific information means information gained from tests done in, or
  samples taken from, limited borings, surface outcrops, near-surface test facil-
  ities, pre-existing tunnels or mines, etc., near the site proposed for charac-
  terization.  It does not imply that a shaft has been sunk.
