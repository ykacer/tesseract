 books, audio-visuals, standards and technical reports of interest to vendors and professional
 information managers.

 As an A111M member, you are entitled to special prices on AUM publications, as described in
 the enclosed literature.  You can place your order by completing the enclosed order forms
 and taxing them to (301) 587-2711, or by calling the AIIIN4 BookStore at (301) 587-8202.  If
 you have any questions about these or other publications available through A111M, please ask
