 Republicans Find Progressive Religion
 In Push to Tax Worker Health Benefits

       WASHINGTON - Conservative Repub-
    licans are sounding an old-fashioned Dem-
    ocratic theme, redistribution of wealth by
    making the federal Tax Code more pro-
    gressive, as they challenge the Clinton
    health-reform plan.
       With striking unity, Republican alter-
    natives to the Clinton plan take aim at
    current tax rules sheltering employer-paid
    health benefits.  No less than the conserva-
    tive Heritage Foundation is leading an
    effort to wipe out the entire $74 billion-a-
    year tax break for individuals and reallo-
    cate the money as a tax credit to help low-
    and middle-income families buy health
    insurance.
       The goal isn't to soak the rich so much
    as to avoid government price controls and
    use the Tax Code to make consumers more
    cost-conscious.  But liberal rhetoric pro-
    vides a useful rationale.

    Powerful Lure
       Organized labor remains the biggest
    barrier to taxing benefits, but it may have
    to rethink its position.  The success of the
    Clinton initiative in Congress rests on
    finding new revenue to finance expanded
    coverage and subsidies for small busi-
    nesses.  The money that could be raised by
    limiting the tax break is inviting to Demo-
    crats, who may urge labor to shift its
    stance to help placate small business.
       "This is high on the list of things that
    make us nervous about health care," said
    Gerry Shea, director of the employee bene-
    fits section of the AFL-CIO.  "This is a big
    pile of money, it's just an easy target."
    Union leaders have begun a letter-writing
    campaign aimed at Ways and Means
    Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., 111.) and
    his Senate Finance counterpart, Chairman
    Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.).
       Still, taxing health benefits, for the
    wealthy at least, was among the options
    discussed by House Ways and Means Com-
    mittee Democrats last week.  And pro-labor
    lawmakers showed support for the idea in
    the panel's health subcommittee last
    month.
       The White House has kept a low profile
    on the tax issue.  Many of its health-care
    financing options, such as cigarette and
    payroll taxes, would fall heavily on largely



  Democratic, working-class families.  Econ-
  omists say its proposal to require business
  to help pay for workers' insurance would
  eat into wages as well.
     The administration has relied so far on
  direct subsidies to offset higher costs and
  give a more progressive cast to its pack-
  age.  But this approach would be expensive.
  The idea of trimming tax benefits instead,
  and recycling the savings to help lower-
  income families pay health bills, strikes
  many as more efficient.
     Despite labor's blue-collar rhetoric in
  favor of the tax shelter for health benefits,
  most studies show that the current ar-
  rangement really does favor the wealthy.
  The Congressional Budget Office last
  month estimated that the tax break for a
  family earning $20,000 to $30,000 averages
  $500 a year, compared with $1,590 for those
  earning $75,000 to $100,000.
     But the tax break is difficult to attack
  because so many households share in the
  benefit; while the rich get more in dollars,
  the shelter also is important to the far more
  numerous middle-income families.  The
  CBO report shows the average benefit is a
  strikingly consistent 2.3% of after-tax in-
  come for families with income of $20,000 to
  $100,000.
     Ultimately, the debate may turn on
  where to cut off the tax break and how to
  recycle the resulting revenue.  While the
  Heritage plan would do away with the
  shelter entirely for individuals, several
  variations would set a cap on the employer
  or employee side of the ledger, or both.  A
  plan proposed by Rep. Jim McCrery (R.,
  La.), for instance, would limit the tax
  exclusion for individuals, and the tax
  deduction for employers, to $2,500 for an
  adult or $5,000 for a family.
     A $5,000 cap wouldn't affect a worker
  making $40,000 a year with $5,000 in family
  health benefits.  A $4,000 cap, by contrast,
  would cost such a worker $150 more in
  taxes, assuming a 15% tax rate.
  Progressive Phasing Out
     One option for Democrats would be to
  phase out the tax preferences at higher-
  income levels.  Individuals earning $40,000
  or less could be left untouched, for in-
  stance, and the exclusion could be progres_
  sively reduced at higher income levels
