 ARE MILWAUKEE-TYPE
PARASITES FLOATIN4 IN
 MY PRINKIN& WATER?



 MAYBE.  In a recent sur-
 vey of drinking water
 supplies in 14 states, re-
 searchers found one in
 four to be tainted with
 Cryptosporidium par-
 vum.  Luckily, it takes a
 lot of the bugs to make
 you sick, and there are
 ways you can keep them
 out of your tap water.
    Milwaukee's water
 system was contaminat-
 ed by this tiny intestinal



 parasite last spring.  Nearly
 2,000 people suffered bouts
 of severe diarrhea, and one
 died. (The deaths of five people
 already suffering fatal diseases
 may have been hastened, as
 well.) Cryptosporidium has
 sickened other communities,
 too, in Georgia, Texas, Penn-
 sylvania, and Oregon.
    The parasite is carried by
 mammals, particularly young
 livestock.  Runoff washes ex-
 creted cryptosporidium. eggs,
 or cysts, into lakes and rivers.
 Most municipalities draw their
 water from these surface sup-
 plies.  To make matters worse,
 the cysts are difficult to detect
 by current tests, and they with-
 stand large doses of chlorine.
    Filtering the water is effec-
 tive, but not perfect.  In Mil-
 waukee, it's believed workers
 at one plant added too little
 of a compound needed to bind
 contaminants into easily re-
 moved clumps, allowing large
 numbers of cysts to slip past
 the filters.  Researchers at the
 federal Environmental Protec-
 tion Agency and elsewhere
 say the normal concentration
 is closer to one cyst in every
 100 liters of filtered water.



 Since it's estimated that 1,000
 cysts are needed to breach the
 immune defenses of a healthy
 adult (perhaps slightly fewer
 for a child), you'd have to
 drink truckloads of filtered
 water a day to become ill.
    Unfiltered water is safe, too,
 if it comes from naturally pure
 aquifers or sealed wells or if
 it meets "filtration avoidance



 criteria" set by the EPA, which
 include standards for keeping
 the watershed clean.
    But 8 percent of Americans
 drink unfiltered water from
 surface sources, many of which
 don't meet the EPA's require-
 ments.  Your water depart-
 ment can tell you about your
 supply.  If it's neither filtered
 nor drawn from a demonstra-
 bly pure source, you are vul-
 nerable to cryptosporidium.
    The simplest solution: At-
 tach a filter to your tap.  You'll
 need one that removes orga-
 nisms as small as 2 microns.
 Be sure to change the device
 weekly or, for greater ease,
 attach a pre-filter to catch
 bigger particles, like rust, that
 can gunk up the works.

 for major reconstruction that
 usually costs $3,000 to $5,000
 and means being out of action
 for months.  It's becoming rou-
 tine for doctors to suggest
 surgery to active patients un-
 der 40, because experience
 has shown that rehabilitation
 alone will leave them frustrat-
 ed, unable to return to playing
 as hard as they did before.
   Physicians haven't been sure,
 though, of the best course of
 action for middle-aged pa-
 tients.  Orthopedic surgeon
 Michael Ciccotti and his col-
 leagues at Thomas Jefferson
 University surveyed 52 patients
 who had torn a ligament be-
 tween the ages of 40 and 60
 and opted against reconstruc-
 tion.  Several years later, he
 found, 85 percent were satis-
 fied with rehabilitation alone.
   The older patients were
 more willing than younger
 ones to live with slightly
 weakened knees because most
 weren't playing sports as in-
 tenselv as they might have a
 decade or two before.  But they
 also got better results without
 surgery, says Ciccotti, because
 they were more apt to wear
 their knee braces and do their
 exercises.  Almost all of them
 returned to playing sports,
 just easing up a little.
   An over-40 ski jumper or
 tennis pro might not be so
 satisfied.  "To return to com-
 petitive, highly pivoting
 sports, they might want to
 consider surgery," says
 Ciccotti.  "But in general,
 middle-aged people don't
 need knee reconstruction."



 Chewing Away
 Tooth Decay
 NEW HAVEN, CONN.-Chew
 on this: Xylitol gum can re-
 verse dental damage.  A study
 of children who chewed gum



  containing the natural sweet-
  ener found that they had fewer
  cavities after about two years
  than when they started.
    Researchers already knew
  that chewing xylitol gum
  helps prevent cavities.  Any
  gum has a protective effect
  because it stimulates saliva,
  which washes away some
  cavity-causing bacteria and
  contains minerals that teeth
  need to harden soft spots.  But
  regular gum contains sugar
  that feeds bacteria, neutraliz-
  ing saliva's benefits.  Xylitol
  slows bacterial growth, allow-
  ing saliva to do its job.
    Now it seems that the gum
  does more than merely pro-
  tect, according to a study
  done by University of Michi-
  gan dental biochemist Kauko
  Mdkinen.  Wkinen and his
  colleagues asked 1,000 chil-
  dren in Belize to chew gum
  containing either xylitol, sug-
  ar, or sorbitol-another nat-
  ural sweetener-three to five
