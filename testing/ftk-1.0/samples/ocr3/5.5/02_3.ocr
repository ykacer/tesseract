 Dear Professor,



        As software engineering moves the world of computing towards a more
 disciplined approach to software development, the Ada programming language
 is gaining widespread acceptance.  Its capabilities for encapsulation, data
 abstraction, and portability make Ada an important contributor to the emerging
 software culture.

        With the growing importance of this culture, there can be no better time to
 announce that the third edition of Software Engineering with Ada is now
 available.  Written by Grady Booch and his new coauthor Doug Bryan, the best-
 selling text provides a comprehensive look at this powerful language.

        The third edition reflects not only Grady Booch's expertise in complex
 software systems and object-oriented development but also Doug Bryan's
 experience teaching software engineering at Stanford University and his research
 into Ada programming environments.  The new edition also features
 comprehensive, up-to-date coverage and expanded pedagogy, including five
 new large-scale programming examples that implement object-oriented methods.

        Enclosed is a detailed brochure on the third edition.  Once you've had the
 opportunity to review it, I think you'll share my enthusiasm for this classic text
 on maximizing the potential of Ada.  You'll also find a brochure on our other
 computer science and engineering titles enclosed.  For more information, please
 complete and mail the enclosed reply card or call 800/552-2499.



 Sincerely,



        11-11
