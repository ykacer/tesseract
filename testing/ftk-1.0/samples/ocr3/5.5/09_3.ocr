     Eldorado Rand group.          The Eldorado Rand group (No. i88, PI. 2)
  comprises three patented claims and 24 unpatented claims.  The bulk of the
  production, amounting to perhaps $i,000,000, has been from two of the
  patented claims, the Quaker City and the Rand.  There are approximately
  6,000 feet of underground workings on the Quaker City claim, including the
  350-fOOt Rand shaft.  The workings explore veins in quartz monzonite.

     The Quaker City claim is 1-75 miles west of Nelson, near the head of
  Eldorado Canyon.  According to Ransome 0907, P- 77), "At the Quaker
  City there are two parallel, nearly horizontal veins about ioo feet apart, the
  upper one being exposed along the hillside for at least 1,200 feet.  The average
  dip of these veins    15',   a direction a little east of north. They have been
  extensively stoped, in many places to a height Of 7 feet . . . The ore consists
  of shattered quartz monzonite which has been cemented and partly replaced
  by calcite and quartz.  Originally the deposit contained finely disseminated
  pyrite, but this is now oxidized and the material is a free-milling gold ore."
     The Rand shaft, near the Quaker City workings, explores a vein that
  strikes N- 70' E. and dips 8o' N. Ransome 0907, P- 77) stated, "The vein is
  tight and consists of little bunches and veinlets of quartz, calcite, and pyrite
  in a somewhat,pyritized quartz monzonite.  The lode has produced some
     'd'zed ore from old workings near the surface

     The Honest Miner claim, a short distance east of the Rand and Quaker
  City, is reportedly the claim on which gold was first discovered in this dis-
  trict (Ransome, 1907, P- 76).  The workings explore two nearly parallel

  northeast-striking veins about 6o feet apart which dip 45' NW. cutting fine-
  ,grained quartz monzonite.  Ransome (1907, P- 77) reported that ore was
  produced from the upper parts of the veins.  The vein material consists of
  quartz and calcite with specks of limonite.

  Location                    Copper King District

     The Copper King (Key West, Bunkerville) district is in the Virgin
  Mountains, in T. I5 S., R- 7o E. The principal properties in the district
  (PI. 12) lie about io miles south of the town of Bunkerville, Nevada.  Bunk-

  History and production
     Copper ore was discovered in the area in the late go's, and later the ore
  was also found to contain traces of nickel and platinum.  Through the years
  several unsuccessful attempts have been made to recover these metals.  The,
  most recent mining activity in the district has been confined to the developer
  mint of tungsten and mica-beryl (see P. I59) deposits (Beal, i965).
     Recorded production, from i9c,8 to i962, has been about 3,500 tons of ore@,
