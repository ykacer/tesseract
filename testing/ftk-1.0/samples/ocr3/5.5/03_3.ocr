BURGESS LAWN MOWING 1994



May 9, 1994



Dear Sheila:



  God Bless You for volunteering to mow Ed and Ruth Burgess's lawn.  You
  signed up for the week of May 13 - 19, which starts this coming Friday.  You can
  mow it whatever day is convenient for you, during that week.  Ed has had
  surgery recently, so you need you need to contact Ruth to coordinate the best
  time for mowing.  Ed is home from the hospital now, but the best time to reach
  her is in the morning.

  Ed and Ruth's phone number is 367- 4233, and their address is 4604 Cinderella
  Lane.  Cinderella Lane is just south of Sahara at Arville, and their house is west
  of Arville.

  Thank you so much for helping the Church do a little bit in return, for all that Ed
  and Ruth do for the Lord.  Please give me a call as soon as possible if your
  schedule is now in conflict with the lawn mowing.



@ May God Bless You in your effort.
