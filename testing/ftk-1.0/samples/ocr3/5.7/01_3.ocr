 ORE GENESIS IN THE NORTH PENNINE OREFIELD     393



     Salinity Studies.-Salinity measurements of the fluid inclusions in Pennine
 minerals were made on a freezing stage consisting of a hexagonal aluminum
 cell with a circular inner wall, around which were placed six thermomodules
 connected in series.  The heat generated on the hot side of the thermomodules
 was removed by circulating pre-cooled tap water through copper plates
 clamped to the thermomodules.  The aluminum cell was fitted with quartz
 windows at top and bottom and a thermocouple placed in the cell in close
 proximity to the sample, which was supported in the center of the cell.  The
 entire system was insulated and the cell filled with acetone.  It was found that
 Application of a current of 10 amps to the thermomodules resulted in a tempera-
 ture of - 18' C within the cell, and that above - 18' C it was possible to
 adjust the temperature in the cell within - 1' C by varying the current fed
 to the thermomodules.  Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain tempera-
 tures lower than about -180 C with this freezing stage.  The stage was
 calibrated by measuring the melting temperature of n-dodecane (M.P.



  -9.6' C) sealed in glass capillary tubes, and by placing the bulb of a ther-
  mometer adjacent to the thermocouple in the cell.
     Fluid inclusions generally exhibit considerable super-cooling before freez-
  ing (33), consequently each specimen was pre-cooled in a mixture of dry ice
  and acetone for 30 minutes and then rapidly transferred to the cooling stage
  which was at a temperature of -18' C. By gradually increasing the tem-
  perature within the cell, the temperature at which the last ice crystal in an
  Illusion melted could be obtained.  These last melting temperatures have
   -en interpreted in terms of the system NaCl-H,0 (Table 3).  In some
  -,stances it was found that the ice crystals in inclusions had already melted
  at - 18' C. In such cases it has only been possible to place a minimum value
  on the salinity of the inclusion contents.
    Investigation of the NaIK ratios of Fluid Inclusions.-In order to measure
  the relative amounts of Na and K in Pennine fluid inclusions samples of
  quartz, fluorite, sphalerite and barite exceeding 100 grams in weight were
  carefully cleaned and then crushed in a clean tungsten-carbide mixer mill for
