MARINATED PORK-AND-VEGETABLE KABOBS



G It With Herbs



         backyard cookout is one of the
         rites of summer.  And now that
         herbs are at their best, it's a
         great time to savor their fresh
flavor in foods cooked on the grill.
   Herbs can be grown both indoors or



 outdoors, in pots or in gardens.  But if you
 don't have an herb garden, you can usu-
 al1v find fresh herbs in your supermarket's
 produce section.  Substitute dried herbs for
 fresh ones by using one teaspoon dried,
 crushed herb for each tablespoon of fresh.



                                                   M



 Begin with a clean grill rack.  To make clean up easier, spray the rack with vegetable
 cooking spray before placing it over- the lit coals.
 Use tongs or a spatula to turn meat because when you puncture it with a fork, the
 meat loses its juiciness.
 Place fish on the grill rack perpendicular to the grill bars to minimize sticking.
 Don't allow the coals to blaze or the food will get a hard, crusty texture.
