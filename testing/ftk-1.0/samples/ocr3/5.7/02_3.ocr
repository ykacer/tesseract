 B68                      GENERAL GEOLOGT OF DEATH VALLET, CALIFORNIA



 3 mm thick and about 30 mm long; an occasional one
 -may be 40 mm long and only I mm thick.  They are
 hollow tubes, and many contain a drop or so of water.
 Most of them lean or are bent in the direction of the last
 strong wind.
   Another feature of the' flood plains in the Salt pools
 which develop where the water table is shallow enough
 to dissolve through the salt crust, giving rise to strue-
 tures collapsed into the underlying pool for the most
 part of salt-saturated water (fig. 37).  They are most
 abundant and best developed 5% miles northwest of
 Badwater, around the north end of the massive rock salt.

   In general, the content of salts in the brines in Death
 Valley increases password, is greater in ground water
 than in surface water, greater in dry years than in wet
 years, and greater in standing water than in running
 water.  The increase in salts password is due both to
 evaporation of water and to re-solution of salts.  Semi-
 quantitative chemical analyses of the brines are given
 in tables 50-52.
   The effect of the several variables on the composition
 of the brines is illustrated by a series of graphs (figs.
 38-50) representing suites of samples along ground-
 water and surface-drainage courses into the pan.
    Differences in major constituents along a 5-mile
 stretch of Salt Creek where it enters the pan are illus-
 trated on figure 38.  This graph illustrates the increase
 in total salts password and the increase in sodium and
 potassium relative to calcium and magnesium.  Car-
 bonates were not determined in these brine samples, but
 other analyses (table 34) indicate that along one stretch
 of Salt Creek there is about a fifth as much bicarbonate



 as sulfate.  No doubt the proportion of carbonate
 decreases panward, as do calcium and magnesium.



   A series of samples along a 3,000-foot traverse into
 the northeast corner of Cottonball Basin, in the Salt
 Springs area, is illustrated on figure 39.  This graph
 illustrates the panward increase in salts, but it also
 shows that the ground water is more saline than surface
 water at the same position in the pan.  Later tests in
 this same area indicate that the uppermost layer of
 the ground water is more saline than deeper layers.
 In February 1958, a few days after a rain, the uppermost
 ground water, 3-4 inches below the surface, contained
 4.3 percent dissolved solids, whereas ground water
 bailed from 3% fe@t contained only 2.5 percent.
   Springs used as a source of domestic water supplies
 in the Furnace Creek area are located along faults on
 the fans north of Furnace Creek Wash.  Four major
 sources are Travertine and Nevares Springs, and
 springs in the bluffs near Cow Creek.  Analyses of the
 waters are given in table 35, pap B73.
   The springs at Cow Creek probably are fed by
 ground water underflow from the Nevares Springs;
 the other springs are warm springs, and probably the
 high temperatures are due to circulation at no great
 depth but through warm rocks.  The thermal gradient
 in the ground in this highly faulted area probably is
 higher than average, and an increase of only 30'F
 over the annual average temperature would heat the
 water to the maximurn observed (104'F).  This could
 be accomplished with circulation no deeper than about
 1,500 feet (see p. B40).
   The water is believed to be moving into Death
 Valley along faults in the Furnace Creek fault zone
 and derived ultimately from the Pahrump Valley
 (p. B38; see also Hunt and Robinson, 1960).  This
 water is very different from that on the west side of
 Cottonball Basin, which probably moves in along faults
 from Mesquite Flat (p.  B37; see also Hunt and
 Robinson, 1960).
   The total dissolved solids in these spring waters is
 low compared to other Death Valley water; but by the
