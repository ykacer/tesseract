  DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY L.M. Kit Car-
  son (1967, Fox Lorber, unrated,
  $79-95) Years before he went Hol-
  lywood with The Big Easy and
  Great Balls of Fire!, director Jim
  McBride scored with this droll put-
  on, a fake underground movie that
  shoots snarky darts through filin-
  student pretensions.  David Holz-
  man (Carson) is a sincere young
  twerp who, seeking Big Truth,
  films his life in what was the then-
  fashionable grainy B&W v6rit6.
  What he finds is a swift corrective
  to all those who think movies are
  more important than reality.  Raw,
  ragged, and right, Diary is both an
  unerring late-'60s time capsule and
  as modern as teen angst.  A- -TB

  DOCUMENTARY



  THE LOST FLEET OF GUADALCANAL
  (1993, Columbia 7WStar $19.95)
  When Robert Ballard, who discov-
  ered the Ttanic and the Bismarck,
  set off in 1992 to find 50 "ghost
  ships" downed in the World War II
  battle of Guadalcanal, he met with
  only modest success.  Fortunate-
  ly, he'd brought reinforcements:
  American and Japanese survivors
  of the harrowing six-month fight.
  Their moving reminiscences 50
  years later, accompanied by vivid
  archival footage, far eclipse Bal-
  lard's underwater video of sunken
  metal.  Combining elements of the
  Jacques Cousteau and war-docu-
  mentary genres, National Geo-
  graphic's Lost Fleet ultimately tran-
  scends both.  A -Susan Chumsky

  PRIDE AND JOY.  THE STORY OF ALLIGA-
  TOR RECORDS Koko Taylor, Lonnie
  Brooks (1993, BMG, $29.95) For
  more than two decades, Alligator
  Records has been introducing
  young, mostly white music fans to
  contemporary hard blues.  The la-
  bel's success story-captured in
  this 87-minute documentary-in-
  volves equal parts nostalgia, clever
  marketing, and a genuine labor of
  love.  Director Robert Mugge (Deep
  Blues) places Alligator in the con-
  text of the Chicago blues scene, in-
  terviews key players, and presents
  some enthralling live performances.
  But the tape still suffers from the
  perfunctory: In band interviews,
  Alligator artists reveal a good-na-
  tured sincerity without ever dig-
  ging deeper than Taylor's remark,
  "We ate it.  We slept it.  We was born
  with the blues." C+ -Taehee Kim





                 TRYING"I'lME

 WITH ARTSIER video renters having
 run through Howards End (which drops
 off the top 10 this week), The Crying
 Game finally joins the chart at No. 7 in
 its third week in release.  Apparently,
 laserdise buyers were awaiting the Oscar
 nominee far more eagerly than tape
 renters: The laser version debuts at a sur-
 prising No. 2.



   Meanwhile, the upward mobility of Columbia THStar/
 Voyager's laserdisc of Bram Stoker's Dracula may soon
 be halted.  Two just-released inexpensive, wide-screen
 versions should cut into the sales of the current pricey
 ($124.99), feature-packed edition.
