Dear George:



 It is time once again for Saint Cloud Hospital to replicate its bi-annual
 consumer research study.  As the incumbent, we surely would like to again
 consider you as a candidate to complete the study.  I would appreciate you
 providing to me at your earliest convenience, a proposal on behalf of your
 firm to do a consumer telephone survey.  The survey will consist of a
 sample size of 600 with roughly the same survey length as we have
 previously done and in approximately the same geographical service area.

 Assuming your firm is interested, I look forward to receiving your
 proposal.  Thank you for your consideration.



 Si @cerel y,
