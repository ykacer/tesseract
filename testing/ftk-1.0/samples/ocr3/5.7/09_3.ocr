      SAN JOSE, Calif. - Jimmy Delgado
      got his gang tattoos to tell the world
      who he was.  He wants to get rid of
      thnbecause of who lie wants to be.
      We distinctive marks turn off pro-
      spective employers, threatening the
      life he plans away from the street.
      "I stopped trying to look for a job,"
      Delgado said.  "Lven if I'm dressed
      nice .. . they don't want to hear what
      I have to say."
      The 17-year-old former member of
      the Palmas gang doesn't plan on hav-
      ing the palm-tree tattoo on his neck
      much longer.
      Ile is among about 100 youths ex-
      pected to take advantage of a new city
      program under which a plastic sur-
      geon will remove gang tattoos for free.
      "A gang tattoo not only says some-
      thing about your past, it can rob you
      of your dreams for tomorrow and
      can damage a young person's self-
      image," Mayor Susan Hammer said
      recently in announcing the program.
      Removing tattoos by surgery or by
      laser can cost several thousand dol-
      lars.  But Dr. Josh Korman, who has
      traveled to poor countries lo repair
      cleft palates and do other reconstruc-
      tive surgery, is donating his services.
      "I think this will give people an
      opportunity to get back into the
      workforce," he said.
      The treatment will be at Forest
      Surgery Center, which is waiving
      most of its fee.  The city is contribut-
      ing $15,000 to cover some of the ex-
      penses and the rental of a laser.
      John Lawrence, 18, plans to take
      advantage of the offer.  Lawrence, a
      former gang member, is back in
      school, working toward his high
      school equivalency diploma, and
      wants to learn various trades.
      Ile plans to cover up the tattoos on
      his arms.  But he wants to remove a
      large "Good Times Bad Times" tattoo
      on his neck, a group of dots on his
      cheek and "Turtle" - his old gang
      name - from above his left eyebrow.
      "When you put on a tattoo, you're
      advertising who you are and where
      you're from," he said.
      At first, he said, "it's fun       You
      don't see all the bad parts. i just got
      -tired, man.  You can't be looking be-
      hind your back forever."
