       The glacial features that were made by the ice tongues

      epoch are even now almost as fresh and unaltered as at the

      formation.  The cirques are still as bare and ragged as if r

      spacing of joints is favorable to frost action.  The original polished ad-,
      striated surface is still rather generally intact, even on such easily  weath.
      ered rocks as coarse granite.  Acres of polished and grooved rock are

      familiar sight near Tenaya Lake (Yosemite National Park) and m

      other places in the high Sierra.  If it were not for the destructive

      of forest fires, such surfaces would be even more completely preserv

      The lateral moraines generally stand out as bold embankments, marred

      only by a few landslides and by sharp ravines where tributary broolm

      descend the canyon sides.  The terminal moraines are still complete, ex-

      cept for V-shaped notches through which the main streams tumble

      down to the plains beyond.  As the distinctive glacial topography of the

      moraines is almost entirely preserved it is generally an easy task to map
      them continuously.

      Most of the valleys that  were inhabited by glaciers of the fourth epoch
      now contain clear lakes 50 to 300 feet deep, some of which are a mile or
      more in length.  The bouldery slopes commonly descend steeply into the

      water.  Deltas at the upper ends of these lakes have grown forward only

      a small fraction of the original length of the lake, and the outlet streaMS

      have incised their morainic dams only 10-75 feet.  Fallen Leaf Lake,

      near Lake Tahoe, held in by a compound loop of terminal moraines, is the

      largest lake of this type on the eastern slope of the range.  Independence,

      Convict, and Donner lakes are similar.  Only a few of the sinaller and

      sh*ower lakes of this age have already disappeared.  The rock-bound

      mountain tarns in the upper parts of the glacial. troughs, largely Bur,

      rounded by bare ice-scor'ed rock mounds, are in substantially the same
      condition now as when the glaciers left theni.
