   @'Riversltv of Tasmania, the writer wishes to
   ,@rencl his appreciation for the many stim-
   jating discussions concerning the regional
   implications of the study.  Special thanks is
   ,,%tended to the many U. S. Geological Survey
   personnel at Mercur@, Nevada for their helpful
   discussions and support in the field.  In addition
   to John Rodgers, the manuscript was read by
   john P. Albers and Mitchell W. Reynolds,
   C, S. Geological Survey, and Lauren Wright,
   Pennsylvania State University.  Their reviews
   led to numerous changes in the manuscript.
   TheU.  S. Atomic Energy Commission was kind
   enough to grant the writer a clearance to work
   in the southern part of the Nevada Test Site.
   Financial support has been provided by the
   Pan American Petroleum Foundation Fellow-
   5hip (1959), Department of Geology, Yale
   Cniversity, and Sigma Xi (1960), and Na-
   tional Science Foundation Grant G. P. 1154

   STRATIGRAPHY
   \fore than 24,000 feet of Precambrian, lower
   Paleozoic and Tertiary rocks crop out in the
   Specter Range quadrangle.  The Precambrian
   and lower Paleozoic rocks are typical of the
   clastic and carbonate rocks in the eastern part
   of the Cordilleran geosvncline, and are more
   than 22,000 feet thick.  The Precambrian and
   Paleozoic rocks have been divided into 16
   mappable units (14 formations, two of which
   contain two members each).  The four oldest
   formations, Precambrian to lower Middle
   Cambrian, are composed of clastic rocks.
   Quartzite, siltstone, and shale are the common
   rock types; limestone and dolomite are minor
   and occur as thin beds.  From lower Middle
   Cambrian through the Upper Devonian, the
   rocks are mainly limestone and dolomite with
   thin units of quartzite and quartz sandstone.
    Tertiary rocks are present mainly in the
   northern part of the quadrangle and overlie
   the Paleozoic rocks with angular uncon-
   formity.  They consist of a basal unit of tuf-
   faceous sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and
   lacustrine limestone, overlain by approximately
   2000 feet of welded and nonwelded tuff of
   rhvolitic and dacitic composition with inter-
   be@ded sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.
   These rocks are mapped as one group sub-
   divided into three informal units.
    Burchfiel (1964) described the formations
   and members mapped during this investigation,
   and general descriptions of these formations
   and members are given in the stratigraphic



   column of rocks exposed in the Specter Range
   quadrangle, Plate 2.

   STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY

   General Statement
   Three structural features of regional sig-
   nificance are discussed and interpreted in rela-
   tion to the structure of the Specter Range
   Quadrangle: (1) the I-as Vegas Valley Shear
   Zone that enters the Specter Range quadrangle
   from the southeast, (2) the extension of the
   Johnnie thrust, and (3) three sets of high-angle
   faults.  Because these structures are of regional
   importance, the data obtained within the
   Specter Range quadrangle will be presented as
   a basis for a regional structural Interpretation.
   The most characteristic structural features
   of the Specter Range quadrangle are the high-
   angle faults, many of which are topographically
   expressed; folding is relatively unimportant
   and local.  The high-angle faults are grouped
   into three sets on the basis of similar strike:
   (1) a northwest set which strikes N 20'-60'
   W., averaging N. 40'-45' W., (2) a north-south
   set whose strike ranges from N. 30' W. to
   N. 35' E., averaging N. 0'-5' E., and (3) a
   northeast set which strikes from N. 35' E. to
   east-west, averaging N. 60'-65' E. (see Fig. 1).
   They are called high-angle faults rather than
   normal faults here because the observed
   stratigraphic displacements can be explained
   by either dip-slip or strike-slip movements.
   the high-angle faults are superposed on older
   folds and faults which are related to the Late
   Mesozoic and Early Tertiary deformation that
   affected the eastern part of the Basin and Range
   province.
    The bedrock of the Specter Range quadran-
   gle can be conveniently divided into six struc-
   tural blocks (Fig. 2).  Structures and trends are
   similar within each block, but differ from those
   of ad'acent blocks; the relationships between
   blocks are not all clear.

   Block I
     Block 1, in the northeast quarter of the
   quadrangle (Fig. 2), consists of a large area
   underlain by rocks of the Oak Springs Group
   of Tertiary age and three discontinuous areas
   of Paleozoic rocks northeast of the Specter
   Range and the northeast-trending ridges north
   of Camp Desert Rock.  Block I is the simplest
   structural block and shows the clearest sequence
   of faulting.
