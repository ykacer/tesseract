    The temperature of the dehydration of interlayer water of Na-montmorillonite (SWy-1,
   American Clay Mineral Society Source Clay) is determined at pressures to I kbar, using
   differential thermal analysis (DTA).  Two dehydration reactions occur, about 40' and 100-C
   above the boiling curve of water.  Above the critical point of water the dehydration
   reactions show only a modest increase of temperature with pressure.  No significant
   differences in temperature were found using different heating rates and different size
   fractions, as defined by their hydraulic diameter.  The presence of two dehydration
   reactions suggests that not all interlayer water is bonded equally, a distinction may be made
   between weakly bonded and strongly bonded water.  It is concluded that hydrated Na-
   montmorillonite is stable under normal pressure and temperature distributions in sedimen-
   tary basins; in these basins dehydration must involve more complex chemical interactions
   with pore fluids.  The large increase in the stability of a hydrated montmorillonite with a
   modest increase in pressure may have important bearing in its use in nuclear waste
   disposal.



                       Introduction

   Clay minerals of the smectite group are important
   components of many geologic systerns.  In addition, they
   have highly diverse applications in industry. ranging from
   pharmaceutical use to purifying agents to backfill in
   radioactive (and other) waste disposal sites.  Further-
   more. they and other diagenetic clays occur as cements
   and pore obstructions in sandstones and may modify the
   composition and quantity of pore fluids; the presence of
   these clays are important in both petroleum exploration
   and in well completion and stimulation.  The varied usage
   of smectites is a consequence of their properties such as
   compaction, plasticity. catalytic activity, swelling, ion
   exchange, density and many others.  These are deter-
   mined by the nature of the interlayer material in smec-
   tites.  This interlayer material (cations and water held
   between the relatively rigid sheets of tetrahedrally-coor-
   dinated and octahedrally-coordinated atoms comprising
   the 2: 1 layer), readily interacts with the environment and
   generally determines its properties.  The stability of the
   interlayer material with respect to temperature and pres-
   sure, therefore. is of great importance in many disci-
   plines.
     Whereas the effect of temperature on the interlayer
   dehydration of smectites has been studied extensively,
   the effect of pressure is not well established.  Much of the
   information available is from drill cuttings and drill cores



   (Whittaker and Dyson, 1980) on the basis of the clay
   mineralogy, but it is difficult to separate the effect-of
   pressure from that of temperature or of the fixation.of
   potassium (which produces i1fite or illite/smectite mixed-
   layer clays) from drill core studies alone.  Nevertheless, it
   is generally agreed that in an open system much of the
   interlayer water is easily removed by pressure, with the
   exception of either the last or last two hydration layo
   (Whittaker and Dyson, 1980).  For example, van Olptin
   (1963) has calculated that in Ca-bentonites a IOadO(
   37,000 p.s.i. is required to remove the next to last waw
   interlayer and 99,000 p.s.i. for the last interlayer.  An
   experimental study (Khitarov and Pugin, 1966) indicates
   that pressure does not significantly increase the stabilkY
   of the interlayer water in smectites.  This is at vari&10
   with other experimental studies on smectites, which sbOW
   that these clays are stable to temperatures of 400 to 50VC
   and pressures of 0.5 and 2 kbar (Eberl et al., 1978).  Eb9d

   et al. point out that increased water pre
   increase dioctahedral smectite stability in hydrothertkW
   systems with a 1: I ratio of smectite to pure water.  These
   results suggest that the more modest pressures
