Several springs with temperatures to 880C discharging 130 L/min.                     0.34          0.066             28
 sulfate-water isotope geothermometer indicates temperatures to 2820C.
 Travertine deposits suggest reservoir temperatures may be lower.

Nosurface discharge; small area altered by gases. Two wells 152                      1.88          0.35           146
 and 1313 m deep; maximum reported temperature of 1440C at bottom
 of shallower well.

Nosurface discharge. A 1.3-km-deep exploration well encountered a                    5.7           1.06           450
 maximum temperature of 1560C at 0.4 km.

Three shallow wells to 229 m with maximum reported temperature of                    0.38          0.079             33
 1320C.  One additional well of unknown depth drilled in 1974.

more than 13 wells ranging in depths from 73 to 2219 m; maximum                      2.0           0.37           157
 reported temperature 2140C.  Springs became inactive after
 drilling of first wells in the early 1960S.  Na-K-Ca geothermometer
 gives 2460C and may indicate a deep source for the water.
 Geothermal fluid with a working temperature of 1540C is used
 commercially to dehydrate vegetables.

Nosurface manifestations. Three wells, deepest 2.3 km, sited by                      7.2           1.78           750
 geophysical techniques; recorded temperatures over 200OC; two
 wells capable of total mass flow of more than 200,000 kg/hr.
 Geothermal fluids are chemically different from nearby Brady area,
 indicating a separate system.

Two deep and one shallow geothermal test wells near Rye Patch KGRA.                  0.45          0.110             47


Several springs with temperatures to 770C. Low flow rates                            1.24          0.23              97
 (20 L/min) may have permitted extensive near-surface water-rock
 reactions which in turn may have adverse effects on the Na-K-Ca
 geothermometer.

Several springs with temperatures to 950C discharging 690 L/min;                     0.96          0.182             77

Twelve wells ranging in depth from 72 to 2917 m; maximum temperature                 1.18          0.30           127
 2110C at 2917 m; similar temperatures reported in shallower wells.

Springs to 900C with abundant sulfur.                                                0.34          0.065             27
