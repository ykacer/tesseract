    Most Of
            The eastern limit of pull-away of the upper limb dur-


    1,Ig folding must have been at or near the north-trending valley


    01i the east f lank of Thimble Peak. East of that veil ey the So-


    nanza King rests In conformable stratigraphic succession on the


    Carrara Formation.  Everywhere west and northwest of that val-


    Jay the Bonanza King Is faulted against older beds.

             Evidence concerning the age of the folding with ac-


    companying log faulting Is somewhat ambiguous.  Southwest of


    Loadflold, beds of the Oligocene Titus Canyon Formation are

    faulted against beds of the Bonanza King along some faults that


    do not extend Into the lower plate.  This might suggest that


    folding and faulting could be at least as young as Oligocene.


    Other bounding faults, however, do extend through the upper


    plate Into the lower.  Because attitudes of Titus Canyon beds


    In the fault blocks are discordant with underlying Cambrian


    beds, dipping In opposite directions on one block, It Is Im-

    probable that the beds were tilted at a common time during fold-


    ing and lag-faultiOg.  Rather, it is likely that the faults
