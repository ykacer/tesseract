     continues to believe that such

     in regard to the generalized concern

 I%* NWPA. while generally conforming
 to the earlier NRC regulations omitted
 the provisions dealinj with NRC review
 of site selection matters.  The
 Commission construes this action as an
 indication that the site selection issues
    Viously dealt with in Pan 00 were to
 97separsted &Om the site
 characterization reports and dealt with.
 instead. in the envuorunantal
 assessments.  Under the NWPA. the
 Cotrunission's role in the review of
 DOE's site characterization plans is to
 determine whether they am appropriate
 in light of the Commission's regulations.
 Attention will be directed toward the
 adequate of the characterization of a
 particular site: and this is different from.
 and not dependent upon. the
 considerations that led to the selection
 of that site.

 a Shaft sinkits



  Some commenters suggested that the
  regulation should be amended to require
  that DOE may not Proceed to
  characterize sites by sinking shafts until
  NRC and State review and comment
  upon the SCP are complete.  One -
  commenter suggested that the regulation
  be clarified to specify that completion of
  NRC review is not a condition precedent
  for shaft sinkingl.  The Commission
  agrees with the commenters who regard
  NW?A as requiring that DOE defer the
  sinking of shafts at least until such time
  as there has been an opportunity for
  artinent comments on shaft sinking to
  Eave been solicited and considered by
  DOL As stated in the preamble to the
  proposed rule. -17he Commission
  believes that Congress intended that
  DOE should provide the plans
  sufficiently far in advance so that
  comments may be developed and
  submitted back to DOE early enough to
  be considered when shaft sinking
  occurs. and all times thereafter.'The
  question. therefore. is not whether the
  Commission agrees with the ob@active of
  those commenters to defer shaft sinking
  until after comments on the SOP have
  been received by DOE.  The issue.  '
  rather. was whether the Commission
  should include in its own regulations an
  interpretation of the obligations of 009
  under the statute.  The Commission has
  concluded that it should do so. in the
  interests of fulfilling its own
  responsibilities more effectively.  The
  Commission has stressed the
  importance of evaluating alternatives to
  major design features that are important
  to waste isolation. set 10 CFR
                     and in the case of the
  design and location of the shafts this
  can only be done prior to their sinking.  It
  is important to the Commission that the
  conunents which it may provide to DOE



 with respect to shaft sinking be taken
 into account as the Department
 proc:11414L
   The Commissiorr observes that the
 incorporation of this language into the
 regulation should have no effect on the
 repository program.  If the established
 working arrangements (including the
 Procedural Agreenient. 48 FR 51976.
 described in the preamble to the
 proposed rule) provide the anticipated
 information exchange.  NRC would in
 fact be able to review and comment in a
 timely fashion during DOEs early
 planning processes on those issues that
 may have a bearing upon DOE's
 decision to proceed with. or delay. the
 sinking of repository shafts.  Moreover.
 the Commission is aware that DOE itself
 has indicated its intention to wait until it
 has completed a review of comments
 before pracesdin# to sink shafts.

 d Simultaneous Aramulgation of
 Amendments



   Some commenters recommended that
   &11 revisions to Part 80 and Part 51 to
   conform them to thaNWPA should be
   promulgated simultaneously.  In
   particular. they recommended that the
   revisions concerrung NEPA
   requirements accompany the revisions
   currently being promulgated.  They
   believe that this would assure that a
   comprehensive and integrated approach
   is taken and any confusion regarding
   NWPA andNT-PA requirements would
   be elitninate& They argue that much of
   Part W now rests on NEPA authority so
   that failure to include NEPA in the
   currently proposed revision casts a
   cloud over the Commission's view of its
   authority to cam out early site reviews.
   The Commission has not put off
   considering its obligations under NEPA
   as modified by the %,VPA.  In
   developing these changes to the
   regulation the Comnussion has
   speci!lcs!ly considered whether any
   procedures might be needed at the site
   screening or characterization Vele. so
   as to assure that the Commissio , would
   be able to meet its ultinizoe NT2A
   responsibilities.  The Co-traission
   concludes that they are not.
    The Commission's Part 51 regulations
   govern the Commission's
   responsibilities for conducting
   environmental reviews associated with
   its licensing and regulatory functions.
   S-ection i2l(c) of NNVPA. 42 U.S.C.
   10141. clearly states that the
   requirements and criteria set forth in
   Part W relate to the Commission's
   responsibility under the Atomic F-rierly
   Act and the Energy Reorganization Act
   and do not require a NEPA ElS.  The Part
   Si changes. on the other hand. will
