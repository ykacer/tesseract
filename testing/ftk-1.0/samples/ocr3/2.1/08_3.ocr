 Comments that appear nearly identical for tte different sites reflect
 information that was presented in the final EA'S that was Very similar among
 sites.  Similar comments do, however, take into consideration differences
 resulting from silte-specific information.

 CCNCLUSIONS) AND RECOMMENDATIONS

 It is apparent that significant efforts were made by DOE to respond to the NRC
 staff major comments on the draft EA's, and in fact many of these commrts have
 teen resolveG. however, for each of the final EA's our review identified
 remaining concerns many of which are the saw type of concerns identified ir
 our review of the draft EA's such as 1) not identifying the ranle ol
 uncertainties associated with the existino 14mited data beset 2 riot
 identifying the range of alternative interpretations and assumptions that can
 t)e reasonably supported by existing data, and 3) hot incorporating a reasonable
 range cf uncertainties and alternative interpretations into evaluations and
 conclusions.  Based on the above we believe that some conclusions in the final
 EA's are stio'. c:verly favorable or optimistic for the areas of ccrment.

 In accordance with our review plan, the NRC staff also reviewed aspects of the
 Methodology Document.  As mentioned earlier the NRC staff eid not evaluate the
 ranking of the sites or the ranking methodoloc
                                                 .Lv itself.  Just as was done for
 *he drafl- EA's, the review focused en the existing data and how that data was
 used in the evaluations in the fine' EA's and the Methodology Document.  From
 this review 411% was clear that evaluations and conclusions regarding site
 conditions presertea in the final EA's were factored into the evaluations of
 scenarios and t@eir consequences presented in the Methodology Document.
 Therefore, conclusions on repository performance in the Methodology Docurent
 that were derived from evaluations and conclusions in the final EA's, that are
 considered in our coniments to be overly optimistic, are likewise considered to
 be overly Optimistic.  Sore examples for the Hanfcrd Site are 1) Insufficient
 ccrsideraticn of flow along large. discrete faults and fracture zones that may
 exist witHn dense flow interiors, including consideration of fracture flow as
 an 'unexpected' feature rather than an 'expected' one, and Z) inadequate
 consideration of alternative assumptions regarding pumping for the       m.11-scale
 exploratory drillirg scenario.  Some factors which wore rot giver sufficient
 corsideration for the salt sites are 1) effects of host rock mass
 heterogeneities and 2) shaft and repository staling concerts related to
 zhermallv irducted salt creep and differential uplift.  An example from the
 Yucca J-,ountair Site is the lack of consideratior that hydrothermal activity
 cculd be a future sourre of fluid important to waste package corrosion.         For
                                                                                  ed
