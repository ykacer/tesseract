    Six teenage friends sit in a Cen-
  treville cafe, trading stories of sexu-
  al liaisons in between cigarettes and
  sips of jasmine tea.  They talk of one-
  night stands.  Long-term courtships.
  Brief flings carried out in the com-
  fort of their middle-class homes.
    A pause, then a question:
    "Do you think," a 16-year-old girl
  asks an adult visitor, "that teenagers
  can really be in love?"
    Over at Kennedy Fligh School in
  Wheaton, another cluster of teen-
  agers huddles around a library table,
  listening to a college-bound senior
  recount how he lost his virginity at a
  small party, at age 12.
    Another 17-year-old Maryland
  youth, Eugene, says that during
  three years of sexual activity-with
  seven partners-he has rarely used



 a condom and fears he will contract
 AIDS.
   These students tell the story of
 adolescent sex in the 1990s.  It is a
 disturbing tale confirmed by coun-
 selors and health professionals:
 Teenagers appear to be starting
 their sex lives younger, many of
 them in middle school, and many are
 having intercourse with multiple
 partners before they finish high
 school.
   This portrait emerged from re-
 cent interviews with two dozen sex-
 ually active teenagers from the
 Washington area.  Some asked not to
 be named, and others asked to be
 identified only by their first names.
 The teenagers spanned the racial
 and socioeconomic spectrum; they
 included class clowns, ace students,
 orchestra members and top athletes.
    In hours of interviews, the teen-
 agers said they regularly have sex at
 home while their parents are asleep
 or away, and they frequently engage
 in impromptu encounters at small
 parties rife with alcohol and other
 drugs.  They said their sexual activi-
 ty is a natural response to a sex-sat-
 urated society and to crushing peer
 pressure.
