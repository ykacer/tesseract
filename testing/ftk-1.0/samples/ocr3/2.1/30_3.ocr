                 workings are the Victory tungsten
                 mine.  Rocks are Triassic(?) volcanic
                 rocks and Triassic and Jurassic sedi-
                 mentary rocks Intruded by a group of
                 Cretaceous plutons ranging from gran-
                 odlorlte to granite.         Tungsten and
                 lead-silver deposits occur In the
                 contact    aureoles    of    the    plutons.

                 In the Shoshone Mountains.

  32.1     1.7    Gabbs. Processing plant of Basic,
                 Inc.    for   magnesite-brucite        ores.
                 Much of the magnetite is used to
                 produce     refectory      products       for
                 furnaces.     The magnetite and brucite
                 occur In dolomite of the Triassic
                 Luning Formation.  In the mineralized
                 area, dark fine-grained dolomite has
                 been marmorized to a lighter colored,
                 coarser-grained massive dolomite that
                 Is Intergrown In varying proportions
                 with magnetite.       A great var I ety of
                 dikes as well as a stock of grano-
                 dlorlte Intrude the Luning Formation
                 In the vicinity of the deposit.  The
                  magnesIte (and recrystallized dolo-
                 mite) Is believed to have formed by
                 the    hydrothermal      replacement       of
                 regionally metamorphosed sedimentary
                 dolomite (Schilling, 1968).

                 and Triassic and Jurassic carbonate
                 and clastIc rocks Intruded by a group
                 of Cretaceous plutons and overlain by
                 Miocene     SHICIC      Ignimbrites       and
                 Intermediate to silicic lavas.

                  The FaIrplay mining district Is lo-
                 cated about 8 miles to the southeast.
                 Most of the mines In the FaIrplay
                 district are associated with epl-


               thermal precious metal deposits In
               Tertiary volcanic rocks.

               Also,     scheelite-bearing       tactite
               occurs adjacent to a granitic pluton.
               In 1978, UV Industriesannounced the
               discovery In this district of 28
               million tons of rock containing 0.25%
               molybdonite with values In silver and
               copper.

                  FMC's Paradise Peak Deposit Is
               located approximately 4.5 miles east
               on the Polellne Road.

 43.8    1.8   The Rex mercury occurrence Is located
               on the left (east).      Mercury occurs
               In Tertiary Intermediate volcanics.
               The mineralization It associated with
               silicification,    argillization,      and
               native sulfur, and Is similar to the
               gold mineralization at the Paradise
               Peak deposit.      The first rock-chip
               sample was taken at the Rex mercury
               occurrence, and led to FMCts dis-
               covery of the Paradise Peak orebody.

               The Rawhide gold-sliver deposit Is a
                joint-venture project between Kenne-
               cott Corp., Plexus Inc,. and Klewlt
               Mining Group Inc.  The deposit has 24
               million tons of ore of current mine-
               able reserves which average .045 oz/T
               Au and .47 oz/T Ag.  The ore Is amen-
               able to heap-leach processing and
               mining will be an open pit operation.
