     Father

     purported to be cleared for farming
     and graced with a house and a well.
     Father and David said farewell to
     my mother and to the children:
     Harry, David's elder brother, and
     Anne, Mary, and Rose.  They depart-
     ed by tram with a huge trunk large-
     ly filled with tools, and with a supply
     of tremendous sandwiches and a con-
     tainer of tea adequate for the three-
     dayjourney through the plains of Illi-
     nois, the hills of Tennessee and the
     pine wilderness of the deep South.
     Foley hes south of Mobile, within
     25 miles of the Gulf of Mexico.  Upon
     their arrival, Father and Dave went
     to the sherifrs office, where they
     found a kindly man who addressed
     them with a German accent.  Since
     Father could speak German, a warm
     relationship sprang up between the
     two men.
     The first things my father needed,
     the shenfftold him, were a horse and
     wagon.  Yes, he knew exactly where
     both might be purchased.  The price
     was $80, and since the mare was in
     foal, my father thought this a bargsin.
     Guided by the sheriff, they fol-
     lowed a dirt country road eight miles
     to the farm.  There, Pa discovered
     that instead of 60 acres being
     cleared, as represented, only 10 were
     suitable for farming.  Nevertheless,
     he set about putting in a crop of
     peas, for which the sheriff assured
     him there was a ready market in
     Pensacola, Fla., 30 miles distant.
     He also went to work on the house,
     adding to one side of it and building
     a screened-in bedroom for David.
     He cut down a large tree and
     scooped out the inside of the trunk so
     it could be filled with water as a
     horse trough.  He bought chickens
     and planted peas, corn and lettuce.
     Once, he thought he had located a
     supply,of wild lettuce, which he
     made into a sumptuous salad, only
     to discover after the first bite that it
     was tobacco!

                   horse, Pa worked
                   from morning to
                   night, then relaxed
                   by reading, in the
     light of a kerosene lamp, one of the
     three books he brought with him one
     contained the essays of Charles Lamb
     and Robert low Stevenson, another
     consisted of lectures on evolution by
     Charles Darwin, and the third was a
     Yiddish book of fiary tales.
     Almost from the first, my father
     recognized the hopelessness of it.
     Surrounded by forest and under-
     brush that would take years to dear,



  they had acquired.  After nine
  months, when Father knew that the
  farm project was a failure, the most
  painful part for David was selling
  the calf.
    When the letter arrived telling
  Mother that Pa was giving up and
  coming back to Chicago, she cried,
  softly and helplessly, for three days.
  She, too, loved farming and had
  shared mi father's dream . Now
  what would become of them?;
    The dreamer corn back to look for
  a job.  He was stern vift himself.  "A
  man must suffer,' he said.
    Dave, who had been a poor stu-
  dent before, now dropped out of
  school and at the age of 14 persuad-
  ed a recruitment officer that he was
  16 and enlisted in the Army.  He
  served as a bugler in World War I
  and, after being mustered out, grav-
  itated to Texas, where he worked on
  a cattle ranch.
    I was born during that war, but it
  was years later that Dave again re-
  turned home and I met my 'true"
  brother whose heroic existence I had
  shared in my dreams.  I regarded
  him as my 'true brother because of
  my identification with his exciting
  life and because my other brother,
  Harry, was so much older, lived
  apart from us with his.own family
  (including a son whom I detested),
  and he simply did not seem like a
  brother.  How wonderful it must be, I
  thought, to have a brother to play
  with.  All I had were sisters, and they
  were no fan at all.
    My sisters assured me that Dave
  had been a boy of infectious charm
  and outstanding good looks, with jet
  black hair and great black eyes.
  What none of us knew, of course, was
  that Dave had turned mean.



  where my mother and father slept.  I
  slept on a day bed that was unfolded
  nightly in the dining room.
    The great room, however, was the
  parlor, which was never occupied ex
  cept by the most important visitors or
  used except for state occasions, such
  as the death of an aunt.  It could be
  looked at, but woe to me if my moth-
  er caught me stepping across the in-
  viable barrier that separated it from
  our normal living quarters.  The sight
  alone, however, was an aesthetic ex-
  perienm of        magnitude Thefin-
  niture was all bought at the store on
  12th Street called Hartrnsn@s.  On the
  day it was acquired, we all went to
  this great store, and my mother and
  my sisters chose each piece after
  much study and deliberation.
    I can still see this special finniture
  being uncrated in our flat, with my
  mother anxiously in attendance to
  make certain each object was in per-
  fect condition, her jewels" from the
  shana (beautiful) store.
    The rug that covered the floor was
  russet with a gold border, floating
  softly on the shining surface of var-
  nished hardwood.  A large bay win-
  dow faced directly over Douglas
  Park, about
               whose trees that radiant
  light we see only in childhood slant-
  ed through the Venetian blinds (they
  were the latest thing) and patterned
  the pale, white walls with bright hor-
  izontal shafts and glowed on the
  dark, polished furnishings, the ma-
  hogany sofa with its velvet uphol-
  stery and the outrageously coiffured
  curls that bedecked the legs of the
  center table.
    Our flat was on the third floor of a
  building that housed virtually every
  living member of my family--uncles
  and aunts, cousins and near cousins.
