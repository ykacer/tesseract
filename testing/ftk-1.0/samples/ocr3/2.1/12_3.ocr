THE COMPLEIT TRAVELER



 aboutelectronic gear of all kinds carried on
 by passengers and used in flight Lap-top
 computers, Nintendo Game Boys, cellular
 phones, videocassette recorders-all of
 these products are coming under scrutiny.
    The threat is a double-whammy.  There
 are concerns that explosive devices could
 be hidden in the circuitry of electronics
 and that airport X-ray inspections are not
 sophisticated enough to detect them.  A
 plastic explosive tucked away inside a
 portable radio destroyed Pan Am flight
 103 over Scotland in 1988.
    More likely, however, is the admittedly
 bizarre-sounding risk that electromag-
 netic signals emitted by the devices could
 interfere with the navigational gadgetry of
 aircraft.  Odd as that seems, some pilots
 have reported planes veering off course
 and gauges going haywire, attributable,
 they suspect, to passengers using elec-
 tronics.  In one case, a pilot reported that
 some instrumentation dials dimmed sud-
 denly and the needles spun around wildly
 on a flight departing Chicago.  Then the
 plane began flying off course.  It turned
 out a passenger in row nine was using a
 lap-top computer.  After he switched it off,
 (lie panel light brightened and the naviga-



tional system returned to normal.  Earlier
this year, a plane approaching John F.
Kennedy Airport in New York narrowly



missed crashing when a first-class passen-

such anecdotal information, there is no
conclusive evidence that the electronic



 gizmos are, in fact, a risk.  No one knows
 for sure that those devices are what
 caused the dysfunctional mechanics.
    "There is no definitive answer yet on
 most electronic devices," says Hank Price, a
 spokesperson for the Federal Aviation
 Administration (FAA).  "With cellular
 phones, some studies show they have inter-
 fered with some portions of flights, but we
 are not sure how and why and where, only
 that they have the potential to do so."
   The Federal Communications Com-
 mission prohibits the use of cellular
 phones while planes are airborne; most
 airlines don't allow passengers to use
 them at all, even when the planes are on
 the ground. (An aircraft's own devices,
 including video screens for movies and
 audio systems for earphones and tele-
 phones, have been designed to conform
 with the navigational system, so they do
 not pose a problem.)
   'Me Air Transport Association (ATA),
 which represents the major U.S. airlines
 in Washington, requested industry-wide
 standards from the FAA on other elec-
 tronic devices.  'Me FAA, however, issued
 an advisory earlier this year leaving it up
 to airlines to decide.  Meanwhile, an advi-
