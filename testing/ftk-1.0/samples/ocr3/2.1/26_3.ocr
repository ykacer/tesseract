              HOSE SNOOTY COUTURE
              wardrobes that cost a zillion
              dollars are yesterdays news.
              These days ies pretty clear
              the smartest fashion choices
              around are those that
   combine great looks with a reasonable
   price tag. (Why else would all the
   biggest fashion houses be falling all
   over themselves to create lower-priced
   lines?) Now it's possible to hit the
   discount stores, armed with a sense of
   style and a skinny wallet, and still
   come away with terrific outfits.  Our
   fashion editors visited some national
   stores and found a closetful of great-
   looking (and affordable) clothes.
   Here are some of the prettiest looks
   for work and for play.
