What's Going On and
What"s Coming Up

New Jersey roots.

 Jersey Jim

 At the Shell Houston Open, Jim
 McGovern became the first New
 Jersey pro to win on the PGA
 Tour since Wes Ellis in 1965.
 True to his roots, the 28-year-old
 McGovern has no plans to move
 to a warmer climate.  Even though
 the temperature dips below freez-
 ing as early as November,
 McGovern enjoys Jersey winters.
    "I like the change of seasons,
 that's probably the best thing,"
 says McGovern.  "My family still
 lives in the area.  It's home, all my
 friends are there."
    You might find McGovern
 playing pickup hoops or taking
 cuts with the local softball team
 when he's home in Oradell, the
 town that also produced football
 coach Bill Parcells and McGov-
 em's brother Rob, an NFL line-
 backer.  McGovern could have
 played college football himself,
 but chose golf instead.  While it
 was a longshot for a guy from the
 Garden State to make it on the
 PGA Tour, it's proven to be a
 wise decision.



 On the sidelines

 This season is another washout for
 Scott Verplank, once the nation's
 most promising young golfer.
 Verplank underwent a second
 surgery on his right elbow last No-
 vember, a year after the first.  As
 of this spring, he still couldn't
 straighten the ann.
    "My career is absolutely in
 jeopardy, so I'm not going to
 jeopardize it any more by trying to
 come back too soon," says Ver-
 plank, 28.  That means, at best, he
 would be ready for the Qualifying
 School this winter.
   Playing hurt has been one of
 Verplank's problems.  He made
 only one of 26 cuts in 1991 before
 he knew the severity of his elbow
 problem; last year, he made just
 one of 13 cuts after surgery for
 bone spurs, which proved to be
 only a partial solution.  The most
 recent surgery was to increase the
 blood flow to his elbow.
   "I haven't watched golf on tele-
 vision," Verplank reports of his
 down time.  "I would rather be
 doing it than watching it."
