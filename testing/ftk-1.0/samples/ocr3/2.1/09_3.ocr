     Life, as most people five it, is a
   rough mixture of plans and happen-
   stance, intentions and flukes, nature
   and nurture, warp and weft.  But his-
   tory is supposed to be orderly, the-
   matic, definitive.
     Transforming sloppy life into
   smooth history is a difficult job, and
   in the case of Richard Nixon the job
   may be next to impossible.  Amen-
   ca's 37th president, who died Friday
   night, was a man of extraordinary

  sanctioned the first televised presi-
  dential debates and starred in the
  first televised "town meetings.' He
  nurtured the Republican "southern
  strategy" and played a crucial transi-
