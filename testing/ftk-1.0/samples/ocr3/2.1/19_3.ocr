 given by be' = 2.303 RT/(1 - O')F, with the values of O' as
 shown on the curves (O = transfer coefficient, n = number
 of electrons, and P = stoichiometric number).
     An important characteristic demonstrated in Figure 4 is
 that the error from the linear polarization assumption is
 asymmetric, ie., greater for anodic polarization than for
 cathodic or vice versa, except for the 0.5 curve (b,' =
 1b,"D.  The asymmetry can be very pronounced, as shown
 numerically in Table 2. Listed here is the maximum value
 of E - E'@ below which the linear polarization error remains
 less than 5%.  The maximum LE is seen to vary consider-
 ably, from 6 to 57 mV, as the anodic Tafel slope is
 changed.

      Basic information of this type can help the corrosion
  engineer decide whether to select anodic or cathodic
  polarization for linear polarization measurements on a given
  corroding metal.  That is not the only choice open, however.
  There is a third technique, namely the dual electrode
  technique-an important variation of the small potential
  approximation.  It combines both anodic and cathodic
  Polarization in a single measurement.  A two-electrode cell is
  used, in which the electrodes are duplicate specimens of the
  test metal.  When a potential difference LE is applied across
  the two electrodes, each experiences a potential change of
  0.5 LE if the two are identical and LE is small.  Therefore,


 the slope of the linear polarization curve (1/6E) for dual
 electrodes is half of the slope for anode or cathode alone. it
 follows that Equation (15A) must be changed to



  to calculate corrosion current from dual-electrode measure-
  merits.

      The dual electrode technique was first developed in
  1963 by Marsh,10 who utilized polarity reversal of the
  applied potential so that both a forward current If and a
  reverse polarity current 1, were measured.  The average of
  these meter readings is inserted into Equation (158) to
  calculate I'.  In application of this method to real corroding
  metals, allowance must be made for the fact that duplicate
  test electrodes seldom yield identical corrosion potentials
  or corrosion currents.  As Marsh showed,' 0 it is neceuary to
  determine the starting potential difference between the two
  test electrodes I and 2, (E' - E*), and to calculate the mean
                             2    1
  current as I - 1/2 (if + Id when JE; - 01 < JAEJ and as I
  1/2 lir - Itl when IE2* - E'I'l > JAEJ.
      Marsh's reversal method has been widely applied in
  engineering studies of corrosion resistant metals.  In fm, in
  the past decade, much more electrochemical corrosion rate
  data have been generated by dual-electrode polarization
  than by anodic or cathodic polarization singly.
      A simpler dual-electrode procedure, which eliminates
  the polarity reversal feature of Marsh's method, was
  recently reported.' 1 It is termed "Direct" method because
  I' is calculated directly from a single current 1. measured
  after increasing the starting potential difference (E2* - El*)
  by an amount &Ed,.  The corrosion current is now



  The applied AEde can be selec  'ted in the range 20 to 50 mV.
  This is a higher range than that which can be reliably
  employed with anodic or cathodic polarization alone.  The
  higher range is justified by the extended linear polarization
  curves characteristic of dual electrodes.' 1
      The Direct method yields a mean corrosion current 11*11
  which is not the arithmetic mean of the corrosion currents
  at the individual test electroclm (111, and ID, but is given
  by' 1



  Note that the mean I* obtained by the Reversal method
  also obeys Equation (16).
      Figure 5 gives a convenient circuit and procedure for
  the Direct method.  While the current circuit is open, cell
  emf is measured with the voltmeter in position 1 and the
  desired applied voltage is set in position 2. Then the circuit
  is closed and the current measured with a zero resistance
  ammeter (eg, Reference 12).
      The Direct method represents a major improvement
  over the Reversal method when I Ei - E      is relatively large.
  An illustration of this is given in Table 3, based on
