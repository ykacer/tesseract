   FIG.3. Representativestratigraphicsectionforsalt.



      The reference section contains a sequence of clastic or evaporative rock
 formations with varying permeabilities and porosities.  These water-bearing
 formations contain and transmit various quantities of groundwater, depending
 upon the regional gradient and certain hydrogeological parameters such as
 porosity, permeability, and formation thickness.  The values for these parameters
 vary considerably from site to site.  The ranges of values obtained from the
 literature search and past experience are listed in Table V.


 2.2. Repository and inventory

      For this study the repository size is based on the area required to dispose
 of the wastes produced by a nuclear economy with a capacity of I 00 GW(e),
 operating at this level for one year.  Under this assumption the area covered by
 the repository would be about 30 ha-, this would require about 15 tunnels for
 storing HLW, MLW and LLW.
      The assumed waste packages are stainless steel canisters (30 cm i.d. and
 300 cm long for HLW), steel canisters (86 cm i.d. and II 5 cm long for cladding
 wastes), and 200-litre carbon steel drums, shielded (20 cm concrete) or unshielded,
