   I            CHAIRMAN PALLADINO: Thank you.

   2            Well, lot me ask one qu*stion either or both of

   3  you can comment on.

   4            If I understand DOE's position, it is that the

   5  purpose of the preliminary dotermination was to assure all

   6  parties that they wore going alter sites that really had

   7  the potential for being suitable, based on the availability

   8  of information.

   9            Now, if one waits until after characterization,

      firm decision, but do you think that is in keeping with the

   1211 intent as DOE expresses it or intorpr*ts it?

   13           MR. TOUSLEY: I would say that a determination

   14 following characterization would certainly still be

   15 preliminary. It would be certainly preliminary to the

   16 ultimate decisions by the Commission on licensing as to the

   17 suitability of the site.

   18           Even the Commission's licensing decisions are

   19 going to be preliminary in this program because we won't

   20 know for  a long time whether theme sites are really

   21 suitable.

   22           Making the determination prior to characterization

   23 is so preliminary as to be meaningless. They are making

   24 that determination in solecting the sites to characterize.

   25 It doesn't add anything to that to say, 'We preliminarily
