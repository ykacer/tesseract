        Pinvon-juniper woodland is not represented in the southern Argus
   Mountains or Slate Range; but this zone Is represented above 6.500 or
   7.000 feet in the Panamint Mountains, some 20 miles northeast of Searles
   Lake and in the northern Artrus Mountains 20 miles northwest of Searles
   Lake.  Associated with this zone are mountain mahogany (Cercots!Zus),
   cliff rose (Cowania), sage (Artemisia) , and mistletoe (Arteuthobium) .

                       MODERN POLLEN RAIN AT SEARLES LAKE

        In 1963, a series of modern pollen traps were placed in an east-west
   transact across the south end of Searles Lake basin along at abandoned
   trackway (see C. 1. Smith, fig. 2).  The traps are standard rain pages
   equipped with filters of 10-micron mesh set in the funnel of the pages.
   The instruments were set up in October when few plants were blooming, and
   the@ pollen filters were collected in 1964, exactly a year later.  Samples
   thus obtained are assumed to represent serial pollen rain for a while
   year's interval.  Trap samples were analyzed for relative compas-irmr. and
   for total numbers of pollen grain* trapped per square centimeter per year.
   Soil samples from each site were analyzed for contained pollen.  The
   purpose of this transect was to determine the absolute number and compo-
   sition of the modern pollen rain at both basin and mountain sites, and to
   compare airborne pollen rain with pollen it local modern soils, and with
   the subsurface pollen stratigraphy.

       The results of this study are summarized In figure 1. Absolute
   numbers of pollee. per square cm/yr ranged from about 200 to 1,200.  The
   higher fallout occurred on the divides (a** bottom of fig. 1).  The most
   common pollen types found in the pollen traps for the year 1963-1964
   were found to represent groups that grow in Searles Valley.  Pollen types
   probably from local plants include:

       Chenopodiateae. saltbush family:   10-30 percent of the counts with
   the higher percentages occurring cm the fans where members of this family
   are best represented.  Members of this family cannot be assigned to genus,
   except for greasawood (Sarcobatus) (a rare pollen type growing in Death
   Valley), and hence one cannot say which local genera of Chenopodisceae are
   represented.  Best representation of Chenopodiacoae pollen both in absolute
   numbers per square centimeters per year and in percentages of the counts
   is in the fan areas where members of this family dominate the vegetation.

      Composites, daisy family:    between 10 and 32 percent of counts. The
   Franseris pollen type, which can be recognized by its long spines, is best
   represented on the ridgetops where this plant Is most abundant.  Percentages
   of ahort-Apined Compositse are about the same across the transact.  Absolute
   ambers of Compositae pollen are greatest on the ridg*tops, in part due to
   a hither representation of Franseria pollen fallout, but also because total
   fallout was greatest there.  Artemisia -(sales) of this family is excluded
   from the Compositae counts in figure I and is discussed later.-
