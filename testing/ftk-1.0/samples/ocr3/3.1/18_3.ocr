Rutgers begins training of workers to pass on iob safety



Effort with Industrial Union Council
 funded by $1.2 million state grant



           By DONALD WARSHAW

         A two-year program designed to
    geometrically expand health and
    safety training of the state's private
    sector workforce opened yesterday on
    the Rutgers University campus in New
    Brunswick.
         The effort to "Train the Trainers"
    to then train other workers is spon@
    sored jointly by the Rutgers Institute
    of Management and Labor Relations
    and the state Industrial Union Council
    (IUC), whose affiliated locals rep-
    resent around 200,000 members in
    New Jersey,
         The training is being funded
    through a $1.2 million grant under the
    state's Workforce Development Part-
    nership Act of 1992 administered by
    the state Department of Labor.
         Assembly Labor Committee
    Chairman Patrick Roma (R-Bergen),
    the program's chief sponsor, and
    Labor Commissioner Peter J. Calde-
    rone joined IUC leaders and Rutgers
    officials at the initial session held at
    the Rutgers Labor Education Center,
         "The act marked the first time
    New Jersey has a stable source of
    funding for occupational safety and
    health," Roma told around 80 union



  members from 16 international unions
  and a handful of corporate representa-
  tives attending the initial session.
       "Health and safety is the lifeblood
  of working people," IUC President
  Archer Cole observed, in praising the
  program and urging the establishment



 yesterday to inform their employers
 about the program and seek their par-
 ticipation.
     Roma said that with some 10,000
 workers killed on the job each year and
 60,000 more fatalities as a result of oc-
 cupational diseases that "claim 2,000
 lives along each year in New Jersey,"
 greater attention to worker health and
 safety is a must,
     He said studies have demon-
 strated those companies adopting co-
 operative programs not only better



 protect their workers, but also enjoy
 greater productivity and profitability,
 adding he too favored worker-manage-
 ment committees.
      These committees, Roma said,
 are called for under legislation before
 Congress to reform the federal Occu-



 pational Safety and Health Act.
     "I will ask the Assembly to join
 with me in memorializing Congress to
 enact OSHA reform," Roma said.
     Calderone said an April meeting
 of the Governor's Safety Committee
 attracted 700 persons from the private



    'Health and safety
   are the lifeblood of
    workingpeople.'
