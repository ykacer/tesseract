  into Kundelungu beds.  Rich ores consist of bornite,
  chalcopyrite, galena, and considerable chalcocite
  and silver, but no cobalt or gold.  Some dissemi-
  nated sulfide ores, similar to the Rhodesian ores,
  have been developed near Tshinsenda.

  Selebi-Pikwe, Botswana.  The Selebi-Pikwe ore de-
  posits are situated in eastern Botswana, 55 kilo-
  meters east of the main rail link connecting South
  Africa with Rhodesia, Zambia, and Zaire.  The min-
  ing complex includes underground and open pit
  mining operations, concentrator, and a smelter at
  the larger Pikwe deposit.  The copper-nickel depos-
  ists comprise two stratabound sulfide deposits 15
  kilometers apart of Archean age situated in the
  highly deformed and metamorphosed gneissic
  successions of the Limpopo field belt.  Both dissem-
  inated and massive sulfides occur in sillfike bodies
  of amphibolites that are conformable within quartz-



 feldspar-biotite-hornblende gneiss.  It is suggested
 that the deposits have a syn- or pre-tectonic intru-
 sive origin.  Post ore folding has resulted in a vari-
 able thickness of the ore.  Widths range from about
 40 meters to less than I meter (Fig. 19-3 1).
   According to Valentine, the Pikwe ore body
 forms an arcuate shape at the surface and has a
 strike length of 3300 meters, which reduces below
 to 400 meters.  The deepest point of intersection of
 the ore zone is 370 meters.  The deposit can be
 divided roughly into three zones: a southern mas-
 sive plus 70 percent sulfide zone with grades up to
 2.5 percent Ni and 1.5 percent Cu, enclosed in grey
 gneisses; a central sernimassive 40 to 70 percent
 sulfide zone underlaid with poorly mineralized host
 amphibolite; and a northern low-grade 0.8 percent
 nickel and 0.8 percent copper zone of generally
 disseminated ore with localized bands of massive
 sulfide distributed throughout the host amphibolite.
