  'Dqisiding on site topography. water bodies, and
  meteorological conditions. the site representative
  extreme windspeeds may be simply interpolated
  values between distributions derived from ex-
  isting wind station data.  For sites located in
  complex terrain, physi  cal modeling may be used
  to relate wind data available at an existing wind
  station to expected wind characteristics at a
  proposed site lCermak 112)).

  4.2 Winds at a Standard LeveL The anemometer
  height above ground varies from wind station to
  wind station and may very from time to time at
  the same station.  Thus, it is necessary to extra-
  polate or interpolate the wind data to a standard
  height.  The standard height shall be 33 ft j 1 0 m).
  The extrapolation shall be done by the power lavr



 where

    V33  is the windspeed at 33 feet
    Vz   is the measured windspeed at height z
         above the ground in feet
    a    depends on terrain roughness at the sta-
         tion site.  Terrain categories defined in
         ANSI A58.1-1982 11 11 @hall be acceptable-
         may also be determined by sit.--specified
         data analyses.

 4.3 Deriving the Extreme Windspeed.  The
 Fisher-Tippett Type I extreme value distribu-
 tion shall be used to obtain the design basis
 wimispeeds.  Typical applications of this approach
 have been demonstrated in Simju Changery and
 Filliben (131.  It may be necessary in regions
 under the influence of different types of extreme
 wind regimen to utilize other statistical distribu-
 tions as long as they can be demonstrated to be
 more applicable to the site being considered
 (Mayne 114)).
