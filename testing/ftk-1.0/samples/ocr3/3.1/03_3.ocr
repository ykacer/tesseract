                           PRE-TERTIARY STRATA

             Pro-Tertiary rocks of  the southern Grapevine Mountains comprise
   the uppermost part of the thick  sequence of Precambrian(?) and Cambrian
   strata that Is widely exposed in the Death Valley area (Jennings, 1958).
   The lower half of the mapped rocks, assigned in ascending order to
   the Stirling Quartzite, Wood Canyon Formation, and Zabriskie Quartzite,
   is largely of detrital origin, composed mainly of siltstone, mudstone,
   and fine sandstone with scattered beds of fine-pebble conglomerate.
   Carbonate rocks form xist of the upper half of the sequence and are
   separated from the detrital rocks by a thin transition zone.  The Carrara
   Formation includes rocks of the transition zone, whereas the carbonate
   rocks are divided into the Bonanza King and Nopah Formations.  These
   carbonate rocks belong to the eastern, or carbonate, facles recognized
   in much of the Paleozoic succession In the eastern and southeastern
   Great Basin (Nolan, 1943; Palmer, 1956, among others).
             The pro-Tertiary rocks are described in detail, because their
   occurrence in the Grapevine Mountains Is the northernmost occurrence
   of the Death Valley "facies" on the east side of Dea" Valley.  Know-
   ledge of the stratigraphic detal I is essential for reconstruction of
   facies patterns, or offsets thereof, by major faults In the area
   (Stewart, 1967), and for comparisons with the White-Inyo Mountains suc-
   cession (Nelson, 1962).
              In the Titus and Titanothere Canyons area, as In most of the
   southern Great Basint the Precambrian-Cambrian stratigraphic sequence
   is virtually continuous; no stratigraphic break coincides WI" the
   boundary between the Precambrian and the Cambrian systems.      In order to
