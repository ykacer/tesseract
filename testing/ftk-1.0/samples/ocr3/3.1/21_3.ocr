 these corrections to the diagram would lower the curve C D E in the im-
 mediate vicinity of D, smoothing out the ang1e at that point, would leave it
 unchanged where it intersects the ordinate of O', and would carry the point
 E farther to the right.  It would raise the curve A B at A, and lower it at
 13, leavin- the central portion unchanged.  The point A, or the intersection
 with the horizontal axis, would be thrown to the left.
      Fifthly, in the construction of the curves no allowance was made for
 evaporation during summer.  The curve D E includes only winter evapora-
 tioll, the curve A B only summer melting.  The rate of evaporation for
 snow and ice has its maximum at O', its law changing at that point.  In
 the general law for aqueous evaporation, the rate of evaporation is a func-
 tion of the difference between the saturation tension corresponding to the
 temperature of the evaporated substance and the actual vapor tension of
 the evaporating air.  Since snow and ice can not rise in temperature above
 0 r11 , they can only be evaporated when the aqueous tension of the air in
 contact  with them is less than the saturation tension for O'. If it rises above
 that, moisture is deposited on the ice as dew, instead of beinf, abstracted
 from it.  In all but very exceptional cases the range of summer tempera-
 tures under which ne'v6 can evaporate is small-from O' to 5' or 6'.  The
 effect of the evaporation is to retard the wasting of the. ice, for the enerrgry
 consumed by it is deducted from that available for melting, and a unit of
 solar heat can melt seven times as much ice as it can evaporate.' The cor-
 rection, if applied to the curve of melting, would slightly increase its upward
 concavity.
      Sixthly, the winter evaporation embodied with the winter precipitation
 in the curve D E is tacitly assumed to have a rate corresponding to the
 mean annual temperature; its rate is really less, being a function of the
 mean winter temperature.  Ali error is thus manifestly introduced, and this
 error is greatest for the annual temperatures corresponding to short winters.
 A corresponding correction of the diagram would raise the line D E by
 amounts increasing progressively from D to E.
