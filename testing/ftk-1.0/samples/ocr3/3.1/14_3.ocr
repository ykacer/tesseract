   the band asked if we would license them
   the name so they could tour.  Judy and I
   said, "Go for it"; we get a small percent-
   age of the take.  I go out and play the
   harp sometimes.  We do Soul Man and
   Knock on Wood.  We rip the house apart.
   PLAYBOY: How do you rate your musical
   abilities?
   AYKROYD: I'm a great emcee-front man
   and I can move onstage.  It's funny and
   exciting to see a man of two hundred-
   plus pounds moving in such a way that it
   looks like he knows reasonably well
   where he's going and he's not going to
   hurt people.
   PLAYBOY: What are your musical tastes
   these days?
   AYKROYD: I listen a lot.  My favorites are
   the Black Crowes, Robert Cray, Bonnie
   Raitt, Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughan,
   Kim Wilson and the Thunderbirds.
   There's also a new band called Blues
   Traveler with an amazing new young
   harmonica player named John Popper.
   PLAYBOY: Might there be another Blues
   Brothers movie?
   AYKROYD: I'm working on a story with
   John Landis, who directed the original.
   We're going to try to bring back every-
   body from the first movie.  We have to
   convince the studio.  The walls of Univer-
   sal are still stained from the first Blues
   Brothers movie.
   PLAYBOY: Stained?  Didn't Universal
   make money on that?
   AYKROYD: Not really, because it cost so
   much.  They made their money back, but
   it was traumatic getting the movie made.
   It was an enormous production.  John
   was out of control.
   PLAYBOY: You've often been criticized for
   creating movies with runaway budgets.
   AYKROYD: We are always criticized for
   costs-for 1941, Ghostbusters, Blues Broth-
   ers-but that money doesn't go into the
   pockets of the actors and directors, it
   goes into the pockets of labor.
   PLAYBOY: And special effects and
   wrecked cars....
   AYKROYD: The major expense of Blues
   Brothers was not the seventy police cars
   we bought from the Chicago Police De-
   partment.  We paid only $700 each for
   them.  The major expense was labor, so
   that's good, it gets people working, and
   why shouldn't the profits of the mega-
   corporations be reinvested in the trades
   ofthis industry?  If I write a big show and
   it costs a lot of money, I make no apolo-
   gies.  I'd be a wealthier man today and a
   better businessman if I sat down and
   wrote small movies that cost little and
   brought in lots.
   PLAYBOY: Will you continue to make se-
   quels-whether based on the Blues
   Brothers, Ghostbusters, Coneheads or
   others?
   AYKROYD: As long as there is something
   new to do with them and it's enjoyable.
   It's kind of nice to have built-in franchis-
   es. The one I don't think we'll necessari-
   ly further exploit is Ghostbusters.  It looks



  like that's about had its run.
  PLAYBOY: Because Ghostbusters II did
  poorly?
  AYKROYD: Yeah.  It opened and Batman
  opened the next weekend and wiped us
  out that summer.  Although we made a
  good movie, itjust wasn't as commercial-
  ly successful as everybody thought it
  would be.  If I could get that team to-
  gether, it would be a real dream, because
  I think there's a great story to be told.
  But it won't be for a while.  By the way, I
  heard a great ghost story about an old
  Manhattan hotel, the Sheraton, that is
  now the Chinese consulate on 42nd
  Street on the West Side.  We were shoot-
  ing on the fifth floor in a banquet room.
  I was outside having a smoke and I saw
  this guy go down the hall in an Air Force
  jacket with master sergeant stripes.  I
  asked him what was up.  He told me he
  was an electronic-countermeasures tech-
  nician who installs ECM packs on F-16s
  and F-106s and all that.  He told me that
  his father worked in the building and
  then he mentioned, "We can't keep
  guards." When I asked what he meant,
  he said they had gone through five secu-
  rity guards.  They would come running
  downstairs, yelling, "You can keep your
  job." They finally questioned one, who
  said, "I was making my rounds and I saw
  something come through a wall."
    When the man was asked what he had
  seen, he said, "It was a man's head and
  shoulders.  He was wearing red." So this
  guy and his dad and brother go up there
  to check it out.  They were walking on
  the fifth floor and they saw something go
  across the hall: a guy wearing a red
  chef's hat and holding a knife and fork.
  They followed him into the kitchen and
  he disappeared into the mashed-potato
  mixer.
    He said they researched the employee
  records of the hotel and found that a
  week after it had closed, the roast beef
  chef, who had been there for fifteen
  years or something, went to a bar
  around the corner and drank himself to
  death.  His presence is still around.
  PLAYBOY: Do you believe that story?
  AYKROYD: It's a perfect example of a
  ghost story I can place credence in be-
  cause it was unsolicited.  Now that the
  Chinese consulate is there, I've wanted
  to talk to someone in charge and ask if
  there have been any experiences with
  the presence.
  PLAYBOY: Have you ever had a personal
  experience with a presence?
  AYKROYD: My wife and I bought'Mama
  Cass' old house in Hollywood.  It is
  where Cream, John Lennon and Harry
  Nillson used to hang out.  Ringo owned it
  for a while.  California Dreamin' was re-
  hearsed there.  We have a presence in
  that house.  A psychic came in and told us
  that some guy apparently died of a drug
  overdose in the living room.  My wife and
  I told a friend of ours about it and he
  turned ashen and gasped.  He said, "I



 know about that." It happened just as
 the psychic said.  It was something that
 had been hushed up.
 PLAYBOY: You called a psychic?
 AYKROYD: We had to.  The maid wouldn't
 go upstairs.  Also, my mother experi-
 enced some stuff there and some friends
 heard the piano playing and then heard
 footsteps and doors closing.  When the
 psychic said she couldn't deal with it, my
 wife went to more traditional methods-
 religion-to try to get rid of it.  But we
 think it's still there because recently the
 other maid went upstairs and a door
 slammed.  Another time I was alone in
 the house in bed and I felt the mattress
 depress behind me like something was
 getting into bed.  You know what my
 reaction was?  I didn't hop up.  I wiggled
 my rump right up next to it.  I thought,
 If you can like me this much, you're go-
 ing to,feel me right next to you.
 PLAYBOY: Did you believe in ghosts as
 a child?
 AYKROYD: Ofcourse.  They had s6ances at
 the old family farm where I grew up.  My
 mother witnessed an apparition.  I once
 saw some lights I couldn't explain.  My
 father was a psychic researcher, so it was
 really passed down to me.
 PLAYBOY: It seems Ghostbusters is your
 idea of a documentary, not fiction.  Are
 you pulling our leg?
 AYKROYD: Definitely not.  The other day
 I read that Harold Ramis, my colleague
 in Ghostbusters, said he doesn't believe
 in ghosts!
 PLAYBOY: And that surprises you?
 AYKROYD: Yes, because he is a very smart
 person.  I'm going to bring him up to
 Dudley Town, Massachusetts and scare
 the shit out of him sometime.  I'll take
 him to the most haunted place on earth.
 He's my man.  He's going.  I can't believe
 he offhandedly says he doesn't believe
 in ghosts when it's a reality of life on
 this planet.  He's going to get spanked
 for that.
 PLAYBOY: Don't you require more proof
 ofghosts than those vague experiences?
 AYKROYD: Sure.  I'm a skeptic.  If some-
 body tells me a ghost story, I want proof.
 I want to know if he or she was smoking
 or drinking.  In eighty percent of the cas-
 es I've inquired about, you can put a
 name to the presence, a human name.
 You know why they're there.
 PLAYBOY: Why are they there?
 AYKROYD: They died in an unfulfilling
 and unsatisfied way and they are linger-
 ing here in this world for something that
 they'll never have.  And it's very simple.
 Very simple.
 PLAYBOY: Frankly, Ramis'view isn't much
 of a surprise to us.
 AYKROYD: But Harold's such a brilliant
 philosopher.  He knows that the empiri-
 cal scientific world is not all there is.
 Maybe that's all he sees.  I just can't be-
 lieve that he means it.  He's such a practi-
 cal man, I suppose.
