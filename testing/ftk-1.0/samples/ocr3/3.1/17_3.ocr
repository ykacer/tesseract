                  PUMICEOUS

          PYROCLASTIC-FLOW
                    DEPOSITS


     Pyroclastic flows are high-velocity surface flows of
  high-temperature fragmental material.  Such flows
  potentially are very destructive because of their high
  temperatures and great mobility.  Historic flows have
  been observed to travel a few kilometers from vents
  at velocities of up to 60 m/s, and analyses of
  prehistoric deposits suggest that large flows can cover
  distances of as much as 100 km at velocities of up to
  200 rn/s.
    Pyroclastic flows are commonly subdivided on the
  basis of constituent materials and grain size into ash
  flows, pumice flows, lithic pyroclastic flows, block-
  and-ash flows, and so on.  Ash flows consist chiefly of
  ash-sized particles of glass shards and phenocrysts;
  the term pumice flow is applied if pumice lapilli and
  blocks are dominant.  Ash flows are a common type
  of pyroclastic flow, especially in large-volume erup-
  tions.  Block-and-ash flows contain abundant, large,
  little-vesiculated fragments and commonly form by
  explosive disruption or gravitational failure of the
  flank of a growing lava dome.  Many pyroclastic
  flows are preceded by a ground-hugging hurricane-
  like surge cloud and accompanied by an overriding
  ash cloud, each of which may r-esult in recognizable
  deposits.
    Pumiceous pyroclastic flows of mafic dacite occur-
  red during six major 1980 eruptions at Mount St.
  Helens (May 18, May 25, June 12, July 22, August 7,
  and October 16-18).  This sequence presented excep-
  tional opportunities to observe and photograph
  pyroclastic flows in motion, study their primary
  depositional features, measure themial and rheolog-
  ical properties, relate size and sorting parameters to
  eruption characteristics, and monitor compositional
  changes.  In general, time intervals between successive
  pyroclastic eruptions increased during 1980, and



 eruptive volumes, vesicularity, and degree of
 chemical differentiation decreased.
   Pyroclastic flows were first observed shortly after
 noon on May 18; resulting deposits extend as much as
 8 km from the vent, cover an area of about 15 km2,
 and have a bulk volume of about 0.2 kM3 (Rowley
 and others).  The deposits form a fan-like pattem of
 sheets, tongues, and lobes of mostly poorly sorted
 ash and clasts of pumice and dense dacite.  Succes-
 sively younger 1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits, in gen-
 eral, cover progressively smaller areas and have
 smaller volumes.  The flows formed along with devel-
 opment of large vertical ash columns.  Most pyro-
 clastic flows originated when bulbous masses of ash,
 lapilli, and blocks rose only a short distance above
 the inner crater before spreading laterally to the
 north, but some flows were observed to result from
 gravitational collapse of parts of an accompanying
 vertical ash column.
   Morphologic and rheologic measurements on pyro-
 clastic-flow deposits of July 22 and August 7 indicate
 that the flows moved as non-Newtonian fluids, most
 readily modelled as Bingham plastics (Wilson and
 Head).  Reverse grading of coarse, low-density
 pumice clasts in marginal levee deposits is interpreted
 as the consequence of briefly increased fluidization,
 r,elated to interaction between the flow and surround-
 ing air at the time of emplacement.
   Petrographic and textural studies indicate that all
 1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits consist mainly of
 juvenile dacite, containing plagioclase, hypersthene,
 homblende, and Fe-Ti-oxide phenocrysts in a vesic-
 ular glassy matrix (Kuntz and others).  In general, suc-
 cessively younger deposits show increasing modal
 proportions of plagioclase, hypersthene, and Fe-Ti-
 oxide phenocrysts, increasing average anorthite con-
 tent of plagioclase, increasing phenocryst:glass ratios,
 and decreasing porosity.  These relations suggest that
 successive eruptions have tapped deeper levels in a
 compositionally zoned magma chamber, have pro-
 gressively depleted the magma of volatiles, and have
 been characterized by decreased amounts of vesicula-
 tion and gas thrust.
