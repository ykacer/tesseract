where C(i,t) is radionuclide concentration at position x and time t, R is
retardation coefficient, C is porosity, 0 is water saturation, D is dif-
fusivity, h is half-life and +u is water velocity.  Equation (14) is solved
numerically, e.g., via a finite difference method.  Then Eq. (14) is ap-
proximated by


 where c is a vector of concentrations at nodes {x      i), A is a matrix which

 depends on U, R, E, 0 and D and on the discretization.  The term B



 porates boundary conditions and sinks/sources.  Equation (15) is called a


 state-space equation.     If Eq. (15) is discretized in time, a state transi-


 tion equation obtains



 This analysis assumes that A and b are constant over At (perfect temporal
 correlation); this analysis is only concerned with spatial heterogeneity.
      Expanding Eq. (16) in Taylor series and taking the expected value leads
 to the relation for the mean value (see Dettinger and Wilson, 1981)


 where the subscript 'loll indicates evaluated at mean value.  Equation (17) is
 the first-order estimate of the mean and has the same form as Eq. (16).  The
 second-order estimate has additional terms.
      The covariance is given by applying Eq. (13) to get


 Any single term in Cov(c(t)) is
