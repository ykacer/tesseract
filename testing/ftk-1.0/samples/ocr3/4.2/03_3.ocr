  more arid than the usual pinyon-juniper climate, but more temperate

  than now.


  Above 5,000 feet (1,524 m) the vegetation mosaic is characteristic of

  the Great Basin Desert and is dominated by sagebrush associations of

  Artemisia tridentata and Artemisia arbuscuZa ssp. nova (Fig. 12).  The

  Distribution of Great Basin associations appears to be limited by mean

  maximum temperature and minimum rainfall tolerances of these "cold"

  desert species.  Pinyon pine, Pinus manophyLla, and juniper, Juniverus

  osteosperrna, are the usual dominants at elevations above 6,000 feet

  (1,829 m) and mix with the sagebrush associations on mountains and

  mesas of the northern and western protions of the Nevada Test Site

  Adjacent to the playas in the closed basins of Frenchman and Yucca

  flats are associations dominated by either shadscale, Atriplex confert,@-

  folia; four-winged saltbush, AtripLex canescens; Lyciwn palZidum-Gra?'@'a;

  or Lycium shockZeyi.  The associations containing species of Lyciwn

  appear to be primarily controlled by low temperatures in these cold air

  drainages, but they are also related to the composition of the bedrock

  types are correlated with highly calcareous soils and appear to be ex-

  ceptional in that edaphic controls are probably more important than

  Shrub coverage within the Mohave Desert types averages about 16% with

  a range of 7% to 23%.  Transitional vegetation types average 29% with a

  range of 12% to 50%, while shrub coverage in Great Basin types averages

  24% with a range of 15% to 37%.  Shrub coverage within the various vege-

  tation types is highly correlated with mean annual rainfall.  Standing

  crop of shrubs in Rock Valley is approximately 3,100 kg/hectare.  Roots

  Winter annual forbs and grasses are the dominant species of ground cover,

  and they contribute most tothe annual production of biomass.  However,
