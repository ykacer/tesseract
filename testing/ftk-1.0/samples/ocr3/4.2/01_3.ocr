   Q. My children don't like meat.  Are
   they missing important nutrients by
   leaving it oil their plates?
   A. Not if they eat other foods that pro-
   vide what meat offers.  From dairy prod-
   LICtS they get protein.  Vegetables and
   fruit provide vitarnins and other essen-
   tials.  Most children eat poultry and
   sonic like fish, both good sources of
   iron.  If your children are excluding all
   rneat, poultry, and fish, consult it pedia-
   trician or qualified nutritionist to make
   sure their diets meet essential needs.

   Q. My son's nine-year-old friend is
   never allowed sweets in his own home.
   When he visits us, he helps himself to
   cookies and can easily consume several
   howls of sweetened breakfast cereal in a
   short time.  Is his family's no-sweets rule
   making him a "closet sweet eater?"
   A. Yes.  Whenever certain foods are for-
   bidden by parents, but arc still available
   to children, children will find ways to eat
   them.  Your son's friend has found a
   black market to satisfy his sweet tooth.
   And these foods are even more tasty be-
   cause they are being eaten oil the sly.
   This is one of the reasons why I don't
   think mothers should put any foods on a
   "good" or "bad" list, even sweets.  Any
   food is appropriate as long as it doesn't
   make a child sick.  I'm not suggesting
   that you provide candy bars for dessert
   tit every meal, but offering cookies or ice
   crearn oil occasion is fine.

      Are peanuts really bad for toddlers?
   @._ Yes.  Small round or hard foods like
   Peanuts or hot dogs can become lodged
   in a small child's windpipe, producing
   anything from pneumonia to complete
   blockage of the airway.  Pediatricians
   strongly discourage feeding toddlers
   small, hard foods.

   Q. Is breast milk really better for my
   newborn daughter?  I prefer to bottle
   feed, but my mother-in-law is making
   me feel terribly guilty about my choice.
   A. Breast milk is the optimal food for
   babies, but as far as growth and develop-
   ment are concerned, there is little differ-
   ence between formula-fed and breast-
   fed infants.  If your baby is average and
   healthy, you aren't putting her at tiny
   risk by choosing formula.

   Q. When is the best time to wean a baby
   from the breast or bottle?
   A. There is no "best" time.  Babies may



  be weaned at tiny time, but we recom-
  mend breast-feeding through as much of
  the infant's first year its possible.

      How often should a newborn be fed?
      Feeding it newborn is a compromise
  between on demand and what's possible
  for the mother.  On average. babies tire
  fed every two to three hours.

  Q. My ten-year-old daughter's appetite
  has recently jumped up considerably.
  Suddenly she's asking for second help-
  ings and nibbling after school.  Why this
  change?
  A. The average ten-year-old girl is about
  to go through a phenomenal growth
  spurt.  Your daughter is eating more be-
  cause girls grow rapidly as their hormones
  shift toward adolescence and the onset of
  menstruation and puberty begins.

  Q. My friend makes all her own baby
  food.  Is her child better nourished as a
  result?
  A. No. Commercially prepared baby
  food is a perfectly acceptable choice for
  parents to make.

  Q. How important is fruit in a child's
  diet?
  A. Fruit has vitamins, minerals, fiber,
  and can supply a child with energy.  You
  find the same nutrients in other foods,
  but fruit is tasty and low-fat, too.

  Q. Obesity runs in my husband's fam-
  ily, and my seven-year-old son has a big
  appetite.  How can I limit his diet with-
  out turning into a nag?
  A. If he is growing consistently and his
  weight is not far out of line for his
  height, there may be no reason to be
  concerned.  At seven, active children eat
  to meet their growth and energy needs.
  However, if your pediatrician tells you
  that your child is quite heavy for his
  height, you may want to think about
  lower-calorie alternatives to some of his
  favorite foods.  But don't nag and don't
  worry.  Emphasize the value of exercise
  and try to provide the right balance of
  foods.

  Q. During busy workweeks, making
  meals is difficult.  My children love fast-
  food dinners, but I worry about relying
  on "junk." How bad is a steady take-out-
  diet?
  A. There is nothing wrong with take-out
  food as long as you don't order tile same
  thing all the time@ Pizza and hamburgers,
  in particular, can have lots of fat and
  salt.  So order pizza one night, then
  turkey or broiled chicken sandwiches the
  next, and after that hamburgers or pizza
  (without the extra cheese, pepperoni, or
  sausage that adds fat).  Round out the
  meals with a salad and offer plenty of
  fru i t.

  Q. Is it true that eating rice or drinking
  the water in which rice has been cooked
  will help a child recover from diarrhea?
  A. In third-world countries, when chil-



 dren [lave an acute bout of diarrhea.
 they are often replenished with it cooked
 rice solution, either tile rice itself or the
 water that comes off the top.  There is
 nothing magical about this approach.  As
 a rule, when a youngster has diarrhea.
 it's important to maintain hydration by
 providing appropriate fluids, and to em-
 phasize a diet rich in starches, grains.
 and vegetables.
