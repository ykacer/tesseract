 fleas.  On this day, all 7,500 of them are
 happily standing upside down biting
 through a plastic membrane to suck up
 the cow's blood on the other side.  One
 Artificial Dog produces 12,000 fleas a
 day, doing work that formerly employed
 about 25 real dogs and cats.
   This morning, Georgi is gathering eggs.
 He does it by removing the pens from the
 dog, then opening each one over a funnel-
 shaped "flea separator." The adult fleas
 hop out and fall into the funnel, where the
 vacuum's suction pins them against a
        "in a high wind," as Georg' puts it.

 The eggs stay behind.
   I comment on how this miracle system
 lets no fleas escape when, sure enough,
 one gets away.  We both dive to the floor to
 grab him, but the flea fakes left and goes
 right, then right again and disappears.
   "If you don't get them by the second
 hop, you usually don't get them," Georgi
 says.  We don't.
   But never mind.  Right now, some
 800,000 of its kin are stowed safely in
 Ziploc bags in Georgi's freezer, ready for
 sale.  The questionis, Who wants them?
   Mostly it's big drug companies and
 chemical labs trying to help me-the lady
 with two cats, four dogs, and Oriental
 rugs that come to life each summer as
 Ctenocephatides felis, the common flea,
 takes over my home.
   And helping they are.  By making an
 extract from Georgi's livestock, Greer
 Laboratories, Inc., in Lenoir, North Car-
 olina, can now offer allergists and veteri-
 narians antigen tests to tell whether you
 or your dog or cat are itching because of
 fleas or something else.
   Even better, during the past few years
 companies have come up with a genuine
 flea-relief breakthrough: new age com-
 pounds called insect growth regulators.
   It's about time that something did the
 trick.  Professional exterminators say fleas
 come right after cockroaches and termites
 as the nation's most troublesome pests.
 Consider that 1 1 0 million dogs and cats
 are scattered among the nation's 94 mil-
 lion households.  And that fleas can be
 debilitating to young animals and tor-
 turous to those with allergies.  In regions
 of high humidity, flea allergy dermatitis is
 the number one complaint at the vet's.
 Americans spend a million dollars a day
 fighting fleas at home and almost three
 times that much-$1 billion each year-if
 you figure in vet bills and exterminators.
   "Oh well, 'A reasonable amount of
 fleas is good for a dog,"' says Georgi,
 quoting homespun philosopher David



 How to Hurt a Flea



           SEE IF YOUR PET
        ACTUALLY HAS FLEAS
Often they aren't obvious, especially if
you're checking a feisty cat or a really
furry Saint Bernard.
Stand your pet on a clean white sheet.
Now brush the animal all over, down close
to the skin.  If dark little comma-shaped
crumbs fall on the sheet, wet some with
water and rub a little.  Turn red?  It's "flea
dirt"-dried blood excreted by fleas.  You've



got them.



STOP THEM FROM



        BREEDING IN YOUR HOME
  Use an insect growth regulator.  Look for
  products containing either methoprene or
  fenoxycarb, sold as do-it-yourself sprays.
  Used properly, they're risk-free for you
  and your animals bur death to flea eggs
  and larvae.  "Foggers" with these growth
  regulators are also good but tricky to use.
  They mostly spread tiny droplets that fall
  straight down and won't drift under sofas
  or around corners.  No matter what you
  use, wash the pet on the same day.
  Vacuum, vacuum, vacuum.  You'll not only
  suck up lots of flea eggs, you'll starve any
  lingering larvae.  Use the powered, rotat-
  ing "beater brush" attachment on your
  vacuum.  Then take that pointy crevice
  tool and get tough with the couch and
  baseboards.  Repeat early and often.
  Wash your pet's bedding once a week with
  detergent.  Dry on high heat.  Flea pupae
  die at temperatures above 95'F and at
  humidities below 50 percent.  If your pet
  doesn't have bedding, give him some.
  You could even put a towel down in the
  car or under a favorite napping bush.
  Consider flea-killing dusts.  If you can stand
  the mess, diatomaceous earth supposedly
  dehydrates fleas and their larvae when you
  sprinkle it on your pet's bedding.  It's hard
  to find, though (check pet shops), and all
  flea experts aren't convinced it helps.
    Borate powder (a.k.a. boric acid or borax)
  is tougher on fleas, but you have to spread
  the stuff on your furniture and carpets and
  then make a point of not cleaning it up.


        00 AFTER THE FLEAS ON
             THE DOG OR CAT

 Attack first with a flea comb (available for
 less than $10 in any pet shop).  Dunk the
 combed-out fleas into a bowl of soapy
 water-quick, before they jump.
 Wash your pet with a gentle shampoo and
 sponge on an insecticide dip.  Some people
 prefer products with plant poisons such
 as pyrethrins (from chrysanthemum flow-
 ers) or D-linionene (from citrus peels).  But

 because some compounds are toxic to
 cats and risky for infants, it's best to talk

 over your whole chemical strategy with
 a veterinarian.
 Don't bet on flea collars.  Scientists have
 now tested dozens of fancy new "ultra-
 sonic" collars and say flat out that they
 don't work.  In one test, some pet owners
 were given functioning collars; some oth-
 ers got ones without batteries.  Both groups
 were equally pleased with the results.
   The more traditional insecticide-laced
 collars do hurt fleas but release their poi-
 son quickly and only up near the head.
 Many vets advise against them.
   One possible exception is the new Ovi-
 trol collar with insect growth regulators.
 It should help keep fleas from reproducing.
 Ignore your friends' advice.  Trust me:
 All the "alternative" methods are about
 as effective as snapping your fingers to
 keep elephants away.  Garlic, brewer's
 yeast, permyroyal oil, cedar chips, euca-
 lyptus nuts-they've all been touted as
 remedies.  But science asks for evidence-
 dead fleas, itchless pets-and it's just not
 there.  In fact, veterinarian Jay Georgi
 once raised healthy flea larvae on brewer's
 yeast and garlic.
