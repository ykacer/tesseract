   1.   Realistic temperature dependent nonlinear Material properties have been
        incorporated in the program and the solution at each point in tine is
        obtained by iteration.

   2.   Each element has a 'birth" and 'death" time. Therefore, stresses at
        different stages of excavation or construction can be obtained.

   3.   The substructure (or super element) option allows areas of the mesh
        representing the surrounding rock mass that are far removed fron the
        high stress regions to be modeled by elastic substructures in which
        all the unknowns are eliminated within these substructures.  As a
        result, only a limited number of elements are required in the iterative
        nonlinear analysis kSee Figure 8).

   4.   beometric constraints have been added to the program which allow coarse and
        fine meshes to be merged without the use of triangular elements.  Therefore,
        a consistently higher level of accuracy is obtained see Figure OA,.

        Prior to the termination of this study, work had begun on the development of
   a three-dimensional element k4 to 27 nodes) with temperature dependent, nonlinear
   properties.  This effort is about half completed, and work was also initiated on
   the development of a general three-dimensional mesh generation prugrdiii for
   underground structures with openings of arbitrary geometric shape.

        It has been demonstrated that USAP is not only an effective program for
   the correlation Studies associated with the Stripa project, but has the potential
   to De used effectively in far more general problems associated with the under-
   ground storage of nuclear waste.  The options of temperdture-depenaent nonlinear
