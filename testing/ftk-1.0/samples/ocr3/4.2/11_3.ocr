 If you think chess is slow and boring, then you've never seen the
 Raging Rooks play it.  "I try to win most of my tournament
 games in ten minutes," says Anthony Grier (above, fourth from
 left).  "I figure out my opponent's plan, stop it, and attack."
   Members of the Rooks-students at Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.
 Junior High School 43 in New York, New York-practice almost
 every day before school and during lunch.  Most study chess
 books and play at home every night.  "When I do well in chess, I
 do well in other things, too," says team captain Edwin Moran, 14,
 second from left.  With Edwin are some of the other Rooks: from
 the left, Tarquin Sarkany, 15; Reuben Thomas, 15; Anthony, 14;
 Danny Collins, 15; faculty advisor Richard Gudonsky, who works
 with them several times a week; and Edward Velazquez, 15.
  The Raging Rooks won the last two New York State Scholastic
 Championships in their division.  They have also tied for first in
 the National Junior High School Chess Championships.

  "I don't usually walk my dog, but that day I felt like getting outside,"
  says John Dow (right) of Vienna, Virginia.  He's recalling the day last
  fall when he walked into the path of an emergency.  His neighbor, in
  the background here, was on a riding mower.  It hit a tree and flipped
  over, pinning her underneath. "I heard her call, 'Help! ... says John, 10.
  "I wasn't scared.  I ran over and lifted the mower about 8 inches off the
  ground"-high enough for the woman to roll to safety.  How did a 72-
  pound boy lift a 400-pound mower?  John's not sure.  For bravery
  beyond his years, John was named Vienna Citizen of the Year.
