Dear Mr. & Mrs. Rice:



 On t1he day the Supreme Couri released the NOW v. ScIleidier
 decision, I discovered an unusual ally.  While the Court said that
 pro-life protesters need not have economic motive to be sued under
 the anti-racketeering RICO law, a pro-abortion leader admitted the
 deeper truth.  Discussing the case on a radio talk show with me,
 he agreed that the decision may seriously chill the free-speech
 rights of all peaceful protesters.

 The ruling clears the way for powerful organizations to file RICO
 lawsuits, threatening the First Amendment rights of social activists.
 Even if these organizations cannot prove guilt under RICO, they
 will now be able to punish protesters with expensive court
 proceedings simply because they disagree with them.

 Our opponents, desperate to silence principled opposition to
 abortion, will now attempt to prove in a lower court that AUL's
 client, activist Joseph Scheidler. is guilty of "extortion."

 "This is a prize fight that has at least three rounds," declared AUL
 board member Robert Blakey, who argued the case before the
 Court.  "NOW has won round one.  But I not only have good
 arguments in this case, I have an innocent client."

 We are fighting for a lower-court victory to establish that social
 protest is not RICO extortion.  Your financial gift will help us to
 continue this crucial legal battle and educate the public that First
 Amendment rights apply to all Americans, including pro-lifers.



With concern,



    v            I
Paige Comstock Cunningham

President
