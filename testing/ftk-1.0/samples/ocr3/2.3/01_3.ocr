  135* West Longitude. A second data set of just the 4TS area for the
  time period 1969-1972 was obtained from U.S.G.S. This set contained
  seismic events detected and located using stations of the U.S.G.S.,
  Sandia Laboratories, Incorporated, and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory local
  seismograph networks.  A third data set was obtained from the U.S.U.S.
  which covzred a section of central California along the San Andreas Fault
  where they employ a dense network of seismograph stations.
      Perspective plots of the earthquake strain release for the California/
  Nevada area were prepared for one-year periods between 1950 and 1973 and
  for ten-year periods 1933-1942 throulh 1%3-1972.  These plots represent
  the cumulative strain release for each of 1,760 1/4' by 1/40 qri(I units
  between 32.5' nd 441.50 North Latitude and 113.5' and 124.5' West Lonqi-
  tude.  In an earlier report (Willis and others, 1973). similar plots were
  published for the Nevada area extending back to 185".  Trend- of carthcluake
  activity are clearly visible on these perspective plots but no pattern of
  migration could be detected in the seismic activity. !Jor could short term
  increases or changes in seismic activity be detected beyond the NTS area
  that would correlate with the WrS testing program.
       Cross-correlation of the 1956 strain release data (a year which
  contained no significant underground nuclear tests) with the strain
  release data for reach year between 1950 and 1973 indicated a reoccurrence
  every 5 to 6 years of high maxii"um correlation coefficients.  This may
  bo due to the reoccurrence of one or more major earthquakes in the same
  grid unit.  As with the visual analysis, no correlations were observed
  with the NTS activity.
