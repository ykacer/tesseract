     CHAPTER VI: HISTORY OF BONNEVILLE BASIN.-Provions to the Bonneville history the basin was
           arid.  Thefirstrisooftbelakewat3witlioiitoverflow,andwasloliginaiutained; ibeYenowclay
           was then deposited.  The second rise Went 90 feet higher, causing overflow, but was of sborter
           duration; the White Mari was then deposited.  The final drying divided the basin into a dozen
           independent basins, the largest of which contains Great Salt Lake.  Since 1845 that lake has
           repeatedly risen and fallen through a range of 10 feet.-The history of Lake Bonneville is par-
           alleled by that of Lake Labontan, and each is connected with a history of glaciation in adjacent
           mountains.  Thir3cotinection,thedepauperationofthefossilshells,andauanalysisoftheeliniatio
           conditions of glaciation, lead to the conclusion that the lacu8trine epochs were epochs of relative
           cold.
    CnApTyn VII: LAK g BONNEVILLE AND VOLCANIc ERUPTION. -The group of small craters and basaltic
           lavafieldtjiiearFillmore,Utah,arecloselyrelatedtothelakehi8tory.  Someeruptioustookplace
           beneath the water of the lake, others since its disappearance, and others again during the inter-
           lacustrino epoch.-Numerous basaltic eruptions occurred in the lake area before the lake period,
           and at still earlier dates rhyolite was extravasated.
    CRAPTYR VIII: LAKE Boq.NEVILLE AND DIASTROPHism.-Orogenic cliange during a period subsequent
           to the lake is shown by fault scarps.  The fonnation of fault scarps is accompanied by earth-
           quakes.-Epoirogenic change during a period stibsequent to the lake is shown by the deformation
           of the planes of the shorelines.  Under the p6stulate that the doming of the planes is due to the
           drying away of the lake, it is conclu* that the strains induced by The unloading of the areas
           exceeded the elastic limit of the material and caused viscous distortion of the earth's crust,
           This result, taken in connection with the phenomena of mountain uplift, leads to an e8tiluata of
           the strength of the crust.
    Ch&PTEi- IX: AGE OF THE Equus FAUNA.-The Equas fauna at its type locality is contained in lake
           beds correlated by physical relations with the uppermost of the Laboutan and Bonneville beds,
           The fauna, previously called later Pliocene, is thus shown to have lived in late Pleistocene time.
