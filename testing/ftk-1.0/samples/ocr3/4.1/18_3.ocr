User-Friendly Courts
For Small Claims

If you're an irate consumer or a small-
business owner who has been stiffed by a
customer who won't pay, you might con-
sider having your day in court-and
serving as your own lawyer.
  Most states have small-claims courts
that are user-friendly, and most allow
plaintiffs and defendants to appear with-
out an attorney You just state your case
in a brief, orderly fashion and present
your evidence.  Don't try to act like a
lawyer.  "Perry Mason" behavior can work
against you with a small-claims judge.
  Attorney Ralph Warner, president of



Nolo Press, a firm that publishes con-
sumer and small-business law books, says
that the "first thing you have to ask
yourself is how much time will you have to
spend to get the results you want."
  You usually can get a fair settlement
with a well-crafted, businesslike "demand
letter," Warner says.  He shows you how
to draft such a letter in his book, Every-
body's Guide to Small Claims Court.  "If
the letter doesn't work," he says, "you can
make good use of it in small-claims court
as an accepted form of evidence the judge
can read."
  Indeed, evidence is the key to small
claims.  You need copies of letters, bills,
invoices, and contracts, and you may need



photographs of damaged goods or other
items that may make your case.
  Warner advises you keep your case
argument to four minutes or so and
practice your statement and introduction
of evidence.  "Judges can't stand long-
winded rambling and will cut you short,"
says Warner, who suggests sitting in on
some small-claims cases to learn from
their procedures.
  Warner's book contains step-by-step
instructions on how to handle your own
case.  The book is available in bookstores
and libraries, or it can be ordered for

 Home Warranties:
 Protecting Your Investment

 When you buy a previously owned home
 that's getting on in years, it's hard to
 know if any major system, such as the
 heater or the central air conditioner,
 might be on the blink of collapse.  So
 should you buy a one-year warranty that
 covers this vital equipment and other
 things, such as the plumbing, the electri-
 cal system, the water heater, and the
 kitchen appliances?
   "Statistics show that not much goes
 wrong during the first year," says Agnes
 Davis, president of American Realty
 Group, in Arlington, Va., adding that it's
 "sometimes better to self-insure." But she
 says it might indeed be worth it if you're
 buying an old house and it's hard to
 determine the age and condition of the
 operating systems and equipment.
   "These warranties are really for both
 the buyer and the seller," says John M.
 Kinker, a Lake St. Louis, Mo., home-
 warranty contractor who is president of
 the National Home Warranty Associa-
 tion.  The nonprofit trade group covers
 more than 90 percent of the nation's
 home-warranty contractors and is based
 at its president's business headquarters.
   "The buyer gets protection against
 having to pay for some major repairs,"
 says Kinker, "the seller gets a good sales
 tool, and, in today's litigious market, the
 warranty tends to discourage lawsuits
 against the real-estate agent and seller."
   Home warranties may cover not only
 major systems and equipment but also
 items such as trash compactors, garage-
 door openers, swimming-pool equipment,
 and hot tubs.
   A home-warranty service contract (it's
 not insurance) costs from $350 to $450 a
 year, depending on where you live and
 what contractor you choose.  Deductibles
 range from $35 to $200 per service call.
 Most real-estate agents know where con-
 tracts can be purchased.  For more infor-
 mation, call the National Home Warranty
 Association at 1-800-325-8144.
   Warranties for new homes are another



matter.  Many builders offer HOW (home-
owner warranty) coverage, which is insur-
ance-backed protection, to buyers for up
to 10 years.  Coverage includes the cost of
repair or replacement, if necessary, for
specific structural items.  Heating and
air-conditioning systems, water heaters,



and appliances are usually covered by
their own manufacturers' warranties.
  Many builders offer HOW coverage,
which is backed by the National Associa-
tion of Home Builders, at no charge to
buyers.  Other building companies may
have their own insured warranties.

Home Appraisals:
Reverse Sticker Shock
With the surge in mortgage refinancing
continuing unabated, some homeowners
are being stunned by sticker shock in



 reverse when they get the lender's ap-
 praised-value report.
   After the real-estate bubble burst in
 the late 1980s, appraisers were accused of
 overstating home values.  "Now they may
 be going too far in the other direction,"
 says Paul Havemann, president of HSH,
 of Butler, N.J., a publisher of mortgage-
 based financial figures.  He calls it the
 91equity trap."
   If you get stuck in this trap, with an
 appraisal that doesn't show enough equity
 in your home to cover the amount of the
 loan, there are things you can do.
   Douglas Brown, president-elect of the
 Appraisal Institute, an association of pro-
 fessional appraisers, notes that "the law
 says the lender must give you a copy of
 the appraisal if you ask for it." He adds,
 "Make sure that they give you the full
 report, not just the government-approved
 cover page." You need all the extra notes
 that show what the appraiser believes are
 attractions and drawbacks.
   You also want to see which recent home
 sales were used as "comparables" for your
 home's value estimate.  "It's quite possi-
 ble," Brown says, "that a nearby home
 sold for a higher price after the appraiser
 worked on your report."
   Or the appraiser may not be sufficiently
 familiar with your neighborhood and may
 have misjudged "comparables" in an adja-
 cent area of lower-quality homes.
   It's also possible that a home that was
 used in the comparables column was a
 "distress" sale.  Someone may have lost a
 job, or there may have been a divorce
 requiring a quick transaction.
   Armed with new facts and figures, you
 should call the appraiser and ask for an
 appointment to go over the report, item
 by item.
   The lender may increase the equity
 figure for your home so you can qualify for
 the loan.  If the appraiser won't budge and
 you feel you have been wronged, you can
 ask the lender to send out another ap-
 praiser to provide a second opinion.
   You'll have to pay another appraisal fee,
 but if you get the loan at the interest rate
 you want, it could be worth it.            M
