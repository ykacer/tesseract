    altitude.  The neuntain3 are composed largely of
    late Mesozoic granitic. batholiths-by far the
    greatest of the balltoliths along the Pacific Coast
    of North America. 1.000 n1iles long and in places
    more than 100 miles wide.  At many places the
    western base of the mountains descends abruptly
    to oceanic depths some thousands of feet below
    sea level: the relief. therefore, is much greater
    than the mountainous heights one sees.  At Van-
    couver and Queen Charlotte islands and the is-
    lands of southeastern Alaska are comparative
    lowlands formed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic
    eugeosynclinal sedimentary formations.  The
    manv islands are separated by deep trenches.
    most of them fault valleys.  The summits are very
    jagged with numerous matterhorns and aretes
    between the ice-filled cirques.  Many or most of
    the glaciers extend to within 500 feet of the sea
    and some reach the sea.  The deep. steep-walled
    vallevs that extend into the mountains form
    spectacular fjords.  During the Pleistocene, gla-
    ciers from the Coast Mountains crossed the Strait
    of Georgia and extended onto Vancouver Island.
       East of the Coast Mountains@ are interior
    mountain ranges, mostly under 8.000 feet altitude,



  and mostly formed of folded Mesozoic eugeo-
  svnclinal formations.  Associated with these
  ranges are extensive plateaus capped by lavas.
  The most extensive of these extends the southern
  half of British Columbia covering about 15,000
  square miles along each side at an altitude of
  about 3,000 to 4.000 feet.  It covers much of the
  south half of British Columbia.  The lava-capped
  plateau, at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, has
  three large shield volcanoes near the middle of
  the west side.  The lavas are Tertiary to Holocene
  in age.  They overlie folded and faulted eugeo-
  synclinal sedimentary formations, including
  Paleozoic rocks on the east and Mesozoic on the
  west.  The canyon of the Frazer River is incised
  into the plateau and reaches the Strait of Georgia
  in a valley that curves around the south end of
  the Coast Mountains (Fig. 18.29).
     Uplift of the Coast Mountains began in Juras-
  sic time. and during the Cretaceous Period this
  was part of a mountainous area west of the geo-
  svnclinal sea that connected the Gulf of Mexico
  and the Artic Ocean (Fig. 2.14,C; p. 378).  Struc-
  tural deformation and igneous activity have con-
  tinued to the present time.  One volcano, Mount
