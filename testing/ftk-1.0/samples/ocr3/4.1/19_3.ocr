 Dear Frank B. Rice:



If you left us because of price, we have good news for you.
AT&T has changed.  And once you see how much, you'll see why
it's easy to switch to AT&T.

             Cash the enclosed check for $75, and we'll
                  automatically switch you to AT&T.

It's a real check, good for $75 -- all it needs is your endorsement.
Simply cash it within 30 days.  Your signature is all we need to
switch you to AT&T Dial-I Long Distance Service, so take it to your
bank today.

This check is just the beginning of long distance value you can bank
on with AT&T.  Because our prices are surprisingly competitive.
Especially when you consider the quality and service you get with AT&T.

                    We've lowered our prices.

Not just once, either.  Since 1984, we've lowered our prices
significantly -- by an overall average of more than 40% for
direct-dialed, state-to-state calls.

Now our prices are more competitive with Sprint and MCI than you
may think.  In fact, the difference may be just pennies per call.*

Plus, AT&T offers substantial savings, compared to our daytime prices,
a majority of the time -- with low prices in the evening and our
lowest prices at night or on weekends, when it's convenient to call.

So if you left AT&T for price, please think it over.

                                                  (over, please)
