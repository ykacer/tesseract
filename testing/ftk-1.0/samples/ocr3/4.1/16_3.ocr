IS YOUR HOME FULLY PROTECTED?



 Dear Homeowner:



 Your family's dream of home ownership is well worth protecting.  Now you can be
 sure that your home will stay in your family if something should happen to you.
 Instead of leaving a mortgage, it is now possible to leave a home that is fully paid for.

 We recently sent you some information on a mortgage life insurance plan called
 Ultralife Plus.  Ultralife Plus is valuable mortgage protection offered by Chubb Life
 Insurance Company of America which is designed to pay off the outstanding
 balance of your loan upon death.

 Your cost for this protection is shown on the enclosed application.  If you wish to
 choose joint coverage, you will enjoy an even greater value.  Since premiums will
 be collected with your regular monthly mortgage payment, Ultralife Plus is
 convenient.

 To participate in the plan, simply complete the application and return it in the
 postage-paid envelope provided.  When your application is approved, you will
 receive a Certificate of Insurance.  If you are not completely satisfied, simply
 return it to us and you will owe nothing.

 If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call 1-800-392-9657,
 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. EST.



Sincerely,A
    A
