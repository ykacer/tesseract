 Judge considers keeping
 rape charges against five



  The Associated Press

     CANTON, N.Y. - A judge has
  30 days to decide whether to rein-
  state rape charges against five
  m  'en who admitted having sex
  with a woman after she passed out
  in a restaurant.
     The victim says waiting for the
  decision is no problem.
     "It's OK.  I've had to do that a
  lot.  I'm used to it," she said Fri-
  day after Acting state Supreme
  Court Justice Eugene L. Nicandri
  reserved decision on the case.
     After delivering 21/2 hours of ar-
  guments, attorneys said they ex-
  pected Nicandri to render his de-
  cision before his 30-day deadline
  because of the widespread atten-
  tion the case has received.
     In October 1991 the woman
  was in a restaurant in Gouv-
  erneur, a talc-mining center of
  4,300 residents about 20 miles



 south of the U.S.-Canadian bor-
 der.
    She passed out while intoxi-
 cated.  She learned a week later
 that five men had dragged her
 from a restroorn and had taken
 turns having sex with her.
   The men - Mariano Pistolesi,
 David Cummings, Michael Cur-
 cio, Mark Hartle and George
 Streeter - pleaded guilty to mis-
 demeanor sexual misconduct in
 village court and were fined $750
 each.
   New York Attorney General G.
 .Oliver Koppell, appointed by
 Gov.  Mario Cuomo as special
 prosecutor in the case, said under
 state law the men's guilty pleas
 should be   voided. Felony rape
 charges were still pending in coun-
 ty court, Koppell said, which
 meant that the village court had
 no jurisdiction In the case to ac-
 cept the pleas.
