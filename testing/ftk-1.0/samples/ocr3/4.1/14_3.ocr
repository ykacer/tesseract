    1          Data available from Investigations 8.3.1.8.1 (volcanic
                  activity), 8.3.1,17.3 (vibratory ground motion), 8.3.1.17.4
                  (preclosure tectonic data collection analysis), and 8.3.1.4.2
                  (geologic framework), and Information Need 8.3.2.2.3
                  (underground facility orientation and layout).

    2          Milestones Z379, Z380, and Z382. A series of reports to be
                  available for use by Issue 1.11 (configuration of underground
                  facilities (postclosure)), assessing the effects on waste
                  package integrity resulting from faulting, folding, deforma-
                  tion, and igneous intrusive processes, and on expected repos-
                  itory ground motions during the postclosure period (Milestone
                  Z381).

    3          Data input to Issue 1.11 from reports assessing the effects of
                  faulting, folding, deformation and igneous intrusive
                  processes on waste package performance.
