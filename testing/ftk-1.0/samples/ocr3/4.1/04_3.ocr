  It's a bumpy ride up a mountain
  road to the s
               'potless home of Paul
  and Louise Des'lets.
     He is a carpet cleaner and local
  landlord, devoutly Roman Cath-
  olic and contemplative.  She
  directs Sunday school at Our
  Lady of Czestochowa Church.  As
  a hospic@ visitin nurse, she com-
  forts patients w9o choose to die
  at home.
     But there are certain choices in
  life that the Desilets cannot
  abide.
     "Allowing fornication to occur
  on property I own places my eter-
  nal soul at risk," says Paul,
  scated in his living room near a
  two-foot statue of the Virgin
  Mary.
     Instead, Desilets, 41, has put
  himself at legal risk by refusing to
  rent an apartment to an unmar-
  ried couple.
     That would be Mark Lattanzi
  and Cynthia Tarail.

  Lawsuit's fifth year

     Lattanzi and Tarail's anti-dis-
  crimination suit is entering its
  fifth year in Massachusetts and is
  sparking a national debate about
  fair housing, religious freedom
  and sexual mores.  Twenty-four
  &roups - from Focus on the
  family to Gay and Lesbian
  AdZlcates and Defenders -
  have filed friend-of-the-court
  briefs in the matter pending
  before the state supreme court.

     Lattanzi came to the Connecti-
  cut River village of Turners Falls
  in 1989 as a Vista worker orga-
  nizing tenants to buy buildings
  and convert them to cooperative
  housing.

     Now, at 27, he is a local coordi-
  nator for a private project against
  housing discrimination.

     When Lattanzi and Tarail saw
  an ad in the local daily newspa-
  per for a $400-a-month, two-bed-
  room apartment, they were inter-
  ested.  They had been sharing the
  rent with a family of four in a
  five-room apartment.



  'Living in sin'
    "Then you'd be living in sin,
  and we don't go for that.  Don't
  you know         a criminal act to
  cohabitate and fornicate?" Tarail
  says she   was told, or words to
  that effect.
    Desilets savs he never said any-
  thing about fiving     sin, but did
                          I
  say he d Id not want to rent to "an
  unmarried cohabitating couple."
    Fornication, defined as sexual
  relations between unmarried
    eople, is punishable by a $30
  Fine andlas long as three months
  in jail in Massachusetts, although
  no one remembers the last time it
  was prosecuted.
    Cohab'tat'  'on was decriminal-
  ized     A87. Since 1974, it has
  been against the law in Massa-
  chusetts to deny housing based
  on mar'tal status.
    Lattanz' and Tara'l never saw
  the apartment.  Thev ended up
  moving to a S500-a-month apart-
  ment and filing complaints with
  the Massachusetts Commission
  Against Discrimination.

  Complaints credited
    In August 1990, the commis-
  Sion credited the complaints.  A
  month later, the state attornev
    eneral filed suit on behalf of
  Tarail and Lattanzi charging
  Desillets and his brother, Ronald,
  47, who     co-owner of the build-
  ing., with violating anti-discrimi-
  nation laws.
    The brothers are represented
  by attorneys from the American
  Center for Law and Justice, a
  Virginia Beach-based law and
  education group founded by
  Christian broadcaster Pat Rob-
  ertson     1991. Its national net-
  work of lawyers is dedicated to
  "Christian advocacy and the pro-
  motion of pro-liberty, pro-life
  and pro-family causes."
    Argping @hat   sex without mar-
  riage is against the dictates of his
  Catholic falth, Paul Desilets says
  he simply exercised his constitu-
  tionally guaranteed freedom to
  practice his religion when he
  refused to rent to Lattanzi and
  Tarail.
    In 1992, the landlords won the
