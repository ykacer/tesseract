  From Joumal wire reports

     Yorba Linda, Calit - Mourners from
  around the world left red roses, burning
  candles and cards Saturday at the Richard
  Nixon Library & Birthplace in memory of
  the 37th president of the United States.
     "We just feet very sad that a great man
  has died," said Bryce Woodbury of Sacra-
  mento, who visited the museum with his
  wife.
     'He's our best friend because he set up
  a new relationship," said Zhou Jie, a busi-
  nessman from Chengdu, China.  Nixon
  normalized relations with China, and on
  Saturday China's leaders hailed the for-
  mer president as a man of "strategic fore-
  sight and political courage."
     Messages from President Jiang Zemin
  and Premier Li Peng praised Nixon for his
  1972 breakthrough visit to Beijing that
  began the rapprochement between China
  and the United States, and for his efforts
  tco@ improve relations even after he re-
  signed.
     Nixon also was well remembered in
  Russia.  President Boris Yeltsin said he
  was "one of the first major world politi-
  ciAns who have understood Russia and
  understood what it was fighting for."
     In the United States, colleagues and
  friends reacted with respect and praise.
     Former President Gerald Ford, who
  succeeded Nixon and pardoned him one
  month after his resignation, lauded Nix-
  on's foreign-policy vision and acuity.
     "I happen to believe very strongly that
  Dick Nixon was one of the finest, if not
  the finest, foreign policy presidents of this
  century," Ford added.
     -Said former President George Bush:



 "The difficulties he encountered in office
 may have diminished his presidency, but
 what should be remembered are his many
 outstanding achievements both foreign
 and domestic."
    Former President Ronald Reagan said:
 "For millions, Richard Nixon was truly
 one of the finest statesman this world has
 ever seen."
    Former President Jimmy Carter, too,
 said Nixon's "foreign policy accomplish-
 ments laid important groundwork for ef-
 forts of the presidents who have succeed-
 ed him."
    Nixon, the nation's 37th president and
 the first to resign the office, never re-
 gained consciousness after suffering a
 stroke Monday.  He died Friday night at
 age 8 1.
    He had left a living will that said he
 wanted no extraordinary measures taken
 to prolong his life.
    His body was taken to an undisclosed
 funeral home where it will remain until it
 is flown to Yorba Linda, Calif., his birth-
 place, on Tuesday, his office said.
    Services will be held at 4 p.m. Wednes-
 day PDT at the Richard Nixon Library
 and Birthplace.  He will be buried on the
 site next to his wife, Pat, who died last
 year.  The Rev.  Billy Graham, a longtime
 Nixon friend, will officiate at the funeral.
