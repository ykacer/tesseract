 the U.S. Geological Survey.  The plot for well 2 (fig. 23b) suggests
 a possible increase in late 1971.  Althoogh the data are sparse and
 inconclusive, they demand further consideration, The following
 paragraphs provide a discussion and evaluation of the significance
 of the reported values and the degree of confidence with which the
 increasing trend may be viewed.
      The first consideration concerns sample collection and analysis
 procedures.
      (1) Although analytical procedures have changed somewhat during
 1957-71, the same basic planchet preparation procedure and instrument
 calibration procedure have remained in use, wherein the same planchet
 is used to count both alpha and beta activities.
      (2) In 1965, collection and-field treatment of samples for
 radiochemical analysis were' changed (see page, 7).  The major effect
 of this change was to go from collection of unfiltered (or filtered
 through paper of unknown pore diameter) samples which had acetic
 acid and chloroform added, to collection of samples filtered through
 a 0.45-micrometer membrane with hydrochloric or nitric acid added,
 The effects of these collection procedures on the alpha and beta
 values might logically be as follows.
   . Unfiltered samples may contain sediment with sorbed alpha or
 beta activity.  Addition of acid would tend to de-sorb this activity
 from the solid phase and thus increase the total activity in solution.
 The filtered samples would contain only particulates smaller than the
 maximum pore size of the filter.  For the 0.45-micrometer membrane,
 only particles smaller than an average bacterium would pass through.
