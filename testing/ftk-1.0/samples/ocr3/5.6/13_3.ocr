FOR NOVICE DECK BUILDERS.



By JOS E P H TRU I N I



               isten carefully and
               you'll hear the sounds
               of summer echoing
 across your neighborhood.  They're
 the sounds of harnmers ringing and
 saws singing as homeowners build
 backyard decks.
    Wooden decks represent the sin-
 gle most popular, do-it-yourself
 home improvement project.  There's
 no mystery to why decks are so pop-
 ular: They're easy to build, afford-
 able and an economical way to gain
 valuable outdoor living space.  And,
 decks hold their resale value.
 According to a survey conducted by
 Remodeling, a trade magazine for re-
 modeling contractors, you can ex-
 pect to recoup nearly 84 percent of a
 deck's cost when you sell your home.
    Here are five distinct decks that
 range from a modest platforrn to an
 elegant, multi-level structure.  And
 only basic carpentry skills are re-
 quired to build them.



   REDWOOD AND TILE

  Two beautiful and enduring materials,
  select-heart redwood and natural slate,
  were used to create this unusual back-
  yard deck.  The design features a con-
  crete patio that's covered with
  12x12-in. gray slate files.  The patio ex-
  tends out from the house and merges
  with a redwood sun deck.  The deck is
  connected to a landing and set of stairs
  that leads to a second-story balcony
  deck (see photograph, page 45).


     Note that part of the deck sits on
 the concrete patio.  The rest of it ex-
 tends out onto the lawn and is support-
 ed by 4x4 pressure-treated posts.  The
 concrete patio Nk as poured with a zig-
 zag outline that's inirrored by the
 stepped-back design of the deck.  This
 eve-catchiriv outline is further accentu-
 ated bv the contrasting color of the ter-





 ra-cotta border tiles.  If your home al-
 ready has a concrete patio, you can
 simply lay tile directly over it using
 thin-set mortar.  If the patio is too
 small, enlarge it by excavating, forming
 and pouring a concrete extension.
     Redwood was chosen for this pro-
 ject because of its natural beauty, di-
 mensional stability and resistance to rot
 and insect infestation. (Note that this is
 true only of the heartwood grades of
 redwood cut from the center of the log.
 The sapwood grades offer less resis-
 tance.) The understructure frame of
 the sun deck was built of 2X8 redwood
 joists spaced 24 in. on-center.  The left-
 hand end of the deck (closest to the
 house) rests on the concrete patio and
 is nailed to a pressure-treated 2x4 cleat.
 The cleat is fastened to the patio with
 lead expansion shields and 3/8-in.-dia. x
 3 -in. lag screws.
     The 2X6 redwood decking was
 nailed to the joists with galvanized
 common nails.  Redwood is soft and
 easy to nail, but be sure to pre-drill
 pilot holes at the boards' ends to pre-
 vent splitting.
     On the landing, at the base of the
 stairs, is a cozy redwood bench con-
 structed of 4x4s and 2x6s.  Above the
 bench is a modest shade arbor featuring
 an overhead lattice made of 2x2s.  Each
 of the steps in the stair-way leading to
 the balcony deck is made of seven red-
 wood 2x4s.  The 2x4s were bolted to-
 gether to form massive 31/2-in.-thick x
 101/2@-in.-deep steps.
     The balcony deck is built off the
 upstairs master bedroom and offers a
 private perch for enjoying the Sunday
 morning paper.  The deck is enclosed
 with a railing made of 4X4 posts, 2x4
 rails and a 2x6 cap.  Note that the 2x4
 rails were installed horizontally to cre-
 ate fewer obstructions and offer a bet-
 ter view than would have vertical
 balusters.
