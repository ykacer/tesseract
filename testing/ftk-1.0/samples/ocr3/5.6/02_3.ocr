   Chinese

   men face


   solitude

      BEIJING (AP) - The govern-
   ment says single Chinese men in
   their 30s and 40s have little hope
   of finding a wife in their own age
   group-
      China has 7.4 million single
   men ages 30-44, but only 454,600
   single women in that age bracket,
   the Guangming Daily newspaper
   reported.
      Worse yet, the single men and
   women may be ill-matched.  Most
   of the men are peasants with
   little education, while most of the
   women live in cities and have
   high school or college degrees.
      The paper said the figures re-
   leased by the State Statistical
   Bureau showed that men who do
   physical labor are least attractive
   as mates, while women who work
   with their minds are least popu-
   lar.
      But it didn't explain why there
   were 16 single men for every sin-
   gle woman, or what happened to
   the peasant women of those ages.
      In recent years, Chinese statis-
   ticians have begun to forecast a
   big marriage gap for the genera-
   tion born in the late 1980s and
   early '90s because of new technol-
   ogy that allows women to dis-
   cover the sex of their fetuses.
   Many Chinese women, limited by
   the government to one child, are
   aborting girl fetuses so that their
   one child can be a son.
      Chinese traditionally prefer
   sons because they are more likely
   to provide support in old age and
   because they carry on the family
   line.  In 1990, China recorded
   113.8 male births for every 100
   female births, far higher than the
   natural ratio of 106 to 100.
      However, census figures for the
   1950s and early '60s, when to-
   day's 30- to 44-year-olds were
   born, do not show any such gap.
