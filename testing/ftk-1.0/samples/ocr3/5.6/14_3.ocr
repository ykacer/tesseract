    FTER HE WON the
    $6,000,6-year-old Dom-
Ainick Caggiano an-
nounced plans to place half
of it in a church poor box.
  His parents certainly ad-
mired his spirit but prevailed



 upon him to put
 the money away
 until he was old
 enough to appre-
 ciate the magni-
 tude of his lar-
 gess.  Whatever
 age that might
 be, people up at



 the Hunts Point Market sure-
 ly still will be telling the story
 of Dominick and the 1994
 basketball pool.
   The market's annual pool is
 taken as seriously as the
 price of arugula, and the en-
 trants include people who
 have spent decades studying
 scores and players and
 coaches.  Several have been
 known to bet as much as
 $10,000 on a single game.
   Yet, the first round of this
 year's pool found neither
 Short Petey nor Fat Bubba,
 or any of the other experts, in
 the lead.  The early leader
 was instead an unknown from
 C & S Produce named Domi-
 nick.  Several entrants were
 prompted to inquire about
 him at C & S, and they were
 told he was the son of the
 firm's founder, John Cag-
 giano.
   The next round showed
 Dominick still in the lead,
 and the entrants became a lit-
 tle more curious.  They now
 asked John Caggiano his
 son's age.  The answer
 brought a universal response.
   "They didn't believe me,"
 John says.
   John managed to convince
 them of the truth.  They recov-
 ered from the shock enough
 to suggest that his son must
 be the luckiest 6-year-old on
 earth.



had been sitting down with
the newspaper each morning
for the past year.  He read
about all sports, but basket-
ball was his main game and
he was soon offering in-
formed opinions about any



 number of teanis.
   By last March, the father
 was impressed enough to put
 up $100 and enter Dominick
 in the annual pool.  The fa-
 ther also entered himself,
 and the two of them sat down
 together at the kitchen table
 to fill their respective sheets.
   The father mixed favorites
 with underdogs for the vari-
 ous rounds of the NCAA
 championships.  He chose
 Florida to take the title.
   "I thought they could go all
 the way," John says.
   Dominick decided that the
 championship would come
 down to Duke versus Arkan-
 sas.  He foresaw that Arkan-
 sas would win.
   "They looked like they
 were playing the best," Domi-
 nick says.
   The sheets were submitted
 to those running the pool,
 and over the days ahead
 Dominick returned home
 from first grade to learn he
 had picked right again.  The
 end of the second round saw
 him doing so well that two
 men called C & S to offer
 $1,000 for his sheet.  The fa-
 ther relayed the offer to his
 son.  Dominick had an imme-
 diate answer.
   "He said, 'No, I want to
 win,'" John remembers.
   Dominick kept his sheet
 and stayed in the lead
 through the regionals.  His
 fellow entrants posed anoth-
