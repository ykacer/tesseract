Experiences iA4th extraterrestrial real, he says

     CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Dr. John
  Mack, a Harvard psychiatrist, has
  never had sex with a space alien, nor
  does he care to.  It could compromise
  his objectivity.
     Mack, a Pulitzer Prize winner,
  firmly believes those people who say
  they had extremely close encounters
  with beings from other worlds.
     And in his new book, "Abduc-
  tion," he relates his findings after
  spending four years studying 120
  11 experiencers" - people who say
  they had sexual or reproductive ex-
  periences with aliens who abducted
  them and took them aboard space-
  ships.
     The 13 case studies in his book
  include Ed, who remembers an alien
  woman taking a sperm sample from
  him when he was in high school;
  Jerry, who says she gave birth to a
  human-alien hybrid; and Peter, who
  tells Mack he had an "alien wife" in a
   parallel universe."
     "There is a consistent reproduc-
  tive theme," Mack said.  "Now, do I
  mean by that literally there are mil-
  lions of babies being made?  I don't
  know.  I can't claim that this is occur-



 ring literally in our physical dimen-
 sion of reality."
    What Mack does claim is that
 experiencers are not mentally ill and
 are not working out the effects of
 rape, incest or other abuse.  Their
 emotional and psychological state
 resembles trauma, he said, and trau-
 ma is the response to something
 outside the body, not inside the mind.
    "They don't want to believe it any
 more than we do," he said.  "They
 want me to find them crazy."
    Descriptions of abductions are
 consistent from patient to patient,
 Mack said.  So he believes the exper-
 iencers, even if he can't explain
 exactly what they experienced.
    One of Mack's patients, a 37-year-
 old undercover debunker, told Time
 magazine that Mack gave her UFO
 literature to read before he hypno-
 tized her.
    "John made it obvious what he
 wanted to hear," the patient, Donna
 Bassett, said.  "I provided the an-
 swers."
    Mack could not be located to
 respond to Bassett's allegations.  He
 declined to comment to the magazine
 about her case.
    His accomplishments include



 founding the psychiatry department
 at the Harvard-affiliated Cambridge
 Hospital and winning a 1977 Pulitzer
 for his psychoanalytic biography of
 T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia).
    Since then, Mack has developed
 an interest in Eastern philosophy and
 religion, and believes it helped liber-
 ate his thinking.
    "We don't have room in our cul-
 ture for this.  It's the elite people, my
 colleagues, who decide what we're
 supposed to believe," he said, "and to
 them this isn't supposed to be."
    Even Mack's fellow researchers
 into the otherworldly think "Abduc-
 tion" is a little, well, out there.
    Dr. William McCall, a physician in
 Anaheim, Calif., said that for 10 years
 he used hypnosis to evaluate exper-
 iencers.  His theory: They're actually
 remembering being born.  People's
 memories of going aboard spacecraft
 match their hypnosis-evoked memo-
 ries of passing through the birth
 canal, he said.
    Budd Hopkins, a pioneer in UFO
 abduction research, said that while
 he agrees with Mack that these
 people had sexual encounters with
 aliens, he has reservations about
 Mack's counseling of people to see



 the experience as somehow enrich-
 ing.  Hopkins said he sees such ex-
 periences as neither good nor bad.
    "I think John is putting a quasi-
 religious spin on the material that
 makes the book more vulnerable to
 criticism," said Hopkins, a New York
 artist who has researched and writ-
 ten about experiencers for 19 years.
