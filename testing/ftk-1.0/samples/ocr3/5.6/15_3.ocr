    EVERY TIME YOU FILL UP

    YOUR CAR IN OREGON, YOU

    TAKE A CHANCE OF BUYING

    SUBSTANDARD GASOLINE.

    WHY ISN'T IT TESTED?

              ean E. Conder might
              hold the record for the
              worst gasoline mileage
              of all time.
       He filled up the tank of his 1992
    Buick Park Avenue at a Bend
    service station last summer and
    drove from the pump to the street
    before his car stalled.
       The 74-year-old retired judge
    from Salt Lake City got the car
    running and made it a few more
    blocks before the car died again.
    This time it wouldn't budge.
       The mechanic at a nearby
    Buick dealership didn't take long
    to diagnose the problem.  Conder
    bought a tank full of muddy water.
       In fact, the repair shop estimat-
    ed that Conder bought as much as
    15 gallons of water.
       "I never encountered anything
    like this," Conder said by tele-
    phone from his Utah home.
       Conder and his wife wound up
    spending four extra days in Ore-
    gon while his car was repaired.  He
    estimated that his tank of water
    cost him close to $1,000 after
    adding in lodging, meals and other
    expenses.
       Not long after Conder returned
    home, he tuned into the television
    news program "60 Minutes" and
    saw a report on bad gasoline.
    That's when he learned that Ore-
    gon is one of six states that do not
    test gasoline quality.


     He also learned that when you
  get burned at the pump in Oregon,
  you have nowhere to turn.

                   LI
     Despite evidence that some Ore-
  gon service stations sell substan-
  dard or mislabeled gasoline, efforts
  to establish a testing program in
  Oregon have been unsuccessful.
     That's largely because consum-
  ers don't demand it and legislators
  can't decide how to pay for it.

     WHAT: Motorists in Oregon buy
     $1.8 billion of gasoline annually.
     Gasoline is the second-largest
     consumer purchase in the state.
     THE PROBLEM: Lack of uniform
     gasoline testing means motorists
     face octane overcharges of up to
     $14 million annually, state officials
     say.  In addition, nobody knows the
     true cost of engine wear and tear
