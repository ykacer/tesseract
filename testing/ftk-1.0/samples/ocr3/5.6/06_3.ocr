Discrimination can pervade

    It happened to Herbert Sharp soon
 after he was hired as a Rocky Hill police
 officer in 1989.
    He was living in Hartford, so he went
 to Rocky Hill one evening to drive
 around and learn the layout of his new
 beat.
    But he learned something else in-
 stead.  Sharp, who is black, was followed
 for miles by a white police officer until
 he left Rocky Hill.



   "If you're black and in a neighbor-
 hood, then you're suspicious," said
 Sharp, 28, the town's only black police
 officer.
   Sharp and eight other black and His-
 panic police officers interviewed this
 month said they were not surpr;sed b@
 recent disclosures that some Avon offi-
 cers had targeted black and Hispanic
 motorists for motor vehicle stops.  They
 said it has happened to them.
   Four 6ther minority officers inter-
 viewed said they have not been stopped
 without cause by other officers.  All the
 officers interviewed were chosen ran-



 domly.
   Those police officers who have been
 hassled said it has happened during
 their off-duty hours when they drive
 into the mostly white suburbs of Hart-
 ford and other large cities to do their
 shopping, banking and other errands.
 The officers interviewed said they have
 been hassled less frequently in recent
 years, but suspect that is partly because
 they are older and drive "family" cars,
 such as station wagons.
   They said although only a few officers
 seem to discriminate, it is a problem that
 taints many suburban departments.
