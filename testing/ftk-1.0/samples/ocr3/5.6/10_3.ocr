              In the Washington novel, as in
      the real-life parlors of Georgetown, the British
           ambassador has wielded unparalleled
      social power.  Sir Robin Renwick is carrying on
           the tradition, with contemporary flair

                  BY CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS



               ntil the middle of the 1970s,
               it was thought proper during
               Washington dinner parties for
               the hostess at a certain point
               to deftly gather the eyes of
               her fellow females or co-
   ferninines and lead them all away to the
   drawing room.  Once there, they could
   presumably discuss menstrual pangs and
   knitting patterns while their helpmeets



 reclined stertorously at the table, crack-
 ing walnuts and worse and giving the
 port a bit of a pasting as they withered
 the credibility of Angola, say, or the
 German Social Democrats.
   One fateful evening at the British Em-
 bassy, Lady Ramsbotham loyally mus-
 tered her sisters and left Sir Peter to his
 bores and bullies.  But then Katharine
 Graham, heiress en titre to The Wash-



  ington Post and Newsweek, announced
  that she was going straight home.  This
  was thought to be a reproach, even a
  gesture (though it later transpired that
  Mrs. G. actually had the flu).  In the re-
  sulting flutter of reaction, Lady Rarns-
  botham vowed to discontinue the age-
  old practice of " ladies' withdrawal, " and
  in swift succession nearly every George-
  town mansion followed suit.  "The only
  exception was Pamela Harriman's, " says
  Peter Jay, who succeeded Sir Peter
  Ramsbotham as ambassador, "and ev-
  eryone knows that Mrs. Harriman is a
  law unto herself."
    True, no doubt, but that law, however
  phrased,, is still something of an English
  law.  It was the British who started the
  idea of strict precedence and sexual seg-
  regation at Washington dinners.  Pamela
  Harriman operates at the crucial inter-
  section of Washington where living mem-
  ories of Churchill and the Blitz-shared
  by veterans such as herself and Evange-
  line Bruce-mingle with high liberal
  politics and elevated social tone.  You
  might not prove a connection between
  Anglophilia and the Georgetown Demo-
  cratic establishment, because proving
  such a thing would be vulgar and strenu-
  ous.  But you may nonetheless assume it
  and not go far wrong.  The embassy
  helps set the pitch and rhythm, both for
  those who don't say "Shall we join the
  ladies?" and for those who do.
    This spring, the British ambassador
  and his lady threw a little dinner dance
  for Harriman.  It wasn't too shabby, es-
  pecially if you bore in mind that it was
  to honor her being gazetted as ambassa-
  dor designate to France.  The Senate For-
  eign Relations Committee hadn't yet had
  the privilege of confirming Harriman,
  and the French Embassy hadn't gotten
  around to organizing its own f8te, so the
  British had managed to pre-empt both
  the Congress and America's oldest ally.
  I counted Les Aspin, Vernon Jordan,
  Alan Greenspan, Richard Helms, Mick-
  ey Kantor, Richard Holbrooke, Federico
  Pefia, Strobe Talbott, George Stephano-
  poulos, and James Woolsey before I had
  properly checked my coat.  Senators
  Daschle and Pryor were on deck.  So were
  the aristocracy, from Susan Mary Alsop,
  Mrs. Vincent Astor, Evangeline Bruce,
  and Joan Bingham all the way to Ben
  Bradlee, Sally Quinn, and Selwa Roose-
  velt.  A sprinkling of key scribes like
  Maureen Dowd, some show-biz types
  like Jack Valenti, some tough guys from
