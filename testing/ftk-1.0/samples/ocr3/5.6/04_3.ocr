Country singers roll up their sleeves to rebuild ravaged Midwest



BIG-HEARTED
country stars are



 donating their time and
 sweat to boost the sag-
 ging spirits of thousands
 of disaster victims in the
 flooded Midwest.
    "We're with you and
 praying for you," singer
 Tony Orlando shouted
 over a loudspeaker, as he
 and other celebs piled into
 the back of relief trucks to
 pass out much-needed
 drinking water.
    Tony and fellow croon-
 ers Andy Williams, Jim
 Stafford, Gene Dove, Steve
 Presley and violinist Sho-
 ji Tabuchi flew into flood-
 ravaged Des Moines, Iowa,
 from Branson, Mo., to boost
 the morale of residents and
 pass out 157,000 gallons of
 water trucked in on 15 trac-
 tor-trailers.
    "We've had good luck
 and been spared," said 62-
 year-old Andy, who was
 decked out in jeans and a
 work jacket as he hugged
 grannies and tots and au-
 tographed waterjugs.  "I'm
 from Des Moines and
 wanted to help.  We'll do ev-
 erything we can to lift spir-
 its despite the weather."
    Tony ignored the pelt-
 ing rain as he led relief vic-
 tims in chorus after chorus
 of Row, Row, Row Your
 Boat while the others joked



 with the locals and signed
 water jugs, cardboard six-
 packs and T-shirts.
    The stars, including
 rocker John Cougar Mel-
 lencamp, also donated
 bucks from their concert
 tickets to disaster relief.
 And superstar Willie Nel-
 son is doing a benefit.
    "They're great sports,"
 says Virginia Hartley, 48,
 who giggled like a teen-
 ager after handsome Tony
 Orlando gave her a hug.
    "I worked all night, then
 stood in the rain for two
 hours to give him a T-shirt,
 And I sang along when he
 sang his hit Tie a Yellow
 Ribbon'Round the Old Oak
 Tree and Michael Row the
 Boat Ashore."
    Gushed Carolyn De-
 Priest: "I'm soaked!  But
 seeing Andy Williams is
 worth waiting for.
    "I've been without wa-
 ter for 12 days.  I've
 learned to do without
 showers and we use wa-
 ter from the downspouts to
 flush the toilets."
    Says Julie Gifford, mom
 of 7-year-old Dale, a cer-
 ebral palsy victim: "This is
 the thrill of a lifetime for
 my son.  He's had 22 op-
 erations and when he's re-
 covering, he loves listening
 to Andy Williams music."
